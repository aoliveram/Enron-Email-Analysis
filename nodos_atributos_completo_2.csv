Based upon this document, we will have ready by Monday pm, the long form EEI for regular negotiation.\n\nthanks\n\nElizabeth Sager\n713-853-6349 w\n713 864-4023 h  \n\n "", ""\nI must leave by 4:30pm today--to meet delivery people @ my home.\n\nSee you all on Monday.\n\nCordially, \nSusan S.

Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose \""the existence of a Master Agreement\"" or \""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation\"" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.\n\nFor your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:\n\n1.\tMaster Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of \""Confidentiality\"" provisions:\n\n << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> \n2.\tForest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the \""Confidentiality\"" provision:\n\t\n << File: non master agreement  list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                  << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> \n\nIf I can be of further assistance, please let me know.\n\nCordially, \nSusan S.

The\nbig rally in the hogs supported the cattle futures today, as did\nshort covering. Prices scored a mildly bullish \""outside day\"" up on\nthe daily bar chart today--whereby the high was higher and the low\nwas lower than the previous session's trading range, with a higher\nclose. \n\nDecember lean hogs closed up $1.80 today at $49.65. A bullish monthly\nUSDA hogs and pigs report Friday-- showing a smaller pig crop than\nlast year--boosted futures sharply higher today. Ideas this week's\nkill will be less than last week's also lent strength to futures\nprices today. \n\nGRAINS: December corn futures closed 2 cents lower at $2.03 1/2\ntoday. Prices dropped to a fresh contract low today on fund selling.\nThe market feels pressure from harvest and uninspired demand. After\ntoday's decline, I don't think there's much downside left in corn. \n\nJanuary soybeans closed unchanged at $4.34 1/4 today. More solid\nexport demand, in the form of strong weekly export inspections data\ntoday, failed to push the market higher. While prices could retest\nthe contract lows scored last week, or even drop below them, I do\nthink the downside from present price levels is limited. \n\nDecember Chicago SRW wheat closed off 3 3/4 cents at $2.91 1/4 today.\nPrices backed off today on some profit\n\ntaking from the recent gains, and no chart damage was done today.\nPrices Friday hit a fresh three-month high. \n\nSOFTS: March N.Y. sugar closed 5 points higher at 6.77 cents today.\nPrices closed near the session high. A fledging three-week-old\nuptrend line is still intact on the daily bar chart--but just barely.\nBears still have the technical edge, overall. \n\nDecember N.Y. coffee closed 25 points higher at 43.65 cents today.\nNot much fresh news. The bears are in full command of coffee at\npresent. The only encouraging news to the bulls is the recent\nincrease in volatility at these lower price levels. \n\nDecember N.Y. cocoa closed $2 higher today, at $997. There was enough\nfollow-through buying today to confirm a bullish key reversal on the\ndaily bar chart. \n\nDecember cotton closed 8 points higher at 28.94 cents in\n\nquiet trading today. Prices last week dropped down below key\nlong-term support at 29.50 cents. This opens the door to declines to\nthe 26-cent area, which is the lows seen in 1972, basis nearby\nfutures. \n\nJanuary orange juice on Friday afternoon closed at 90.65. That's up\n155 points from the Thursday evening close. Prices gapped higher\nFriday and bulls still have the big edge. \n\nMETALS: December COMEX gold futures closed up $1.40 at $279.70 an\nounce today. The weaker U.S. dollar helped the yellow metal today.\nPrices are still seeing a corrective bounce in a bear market, but\nbulls will take what they can get at present. \n\nDecember silver futures closed $0.028 higher at $4.243 an ounce\ntoday. Prices hit a fresh five-week low last week and bears have the\nbig edge. \n\nDecember N.Y. copper closed 40 points lower at 63.10 cents. Prices\nlast week dropped to a contract low of 62.00 cents. Bears rule.\n\nENERGIES: December crude closed $0.10 higher at $22.15 today. It was\na fairly quiet day. The daily chart still looks bearish. However, the\nlonger the market trades sideways, the more that favors the bulls and\nsome \""basing\"" activity. \n\nDecember heating oil closed 33 points higher at .6337 today. It was a\nquiet day today. The daily chart still looks bearish as prices hover\nnot that far above the recent lows. \n\nDecember unleaded gasoline closed 8 points lower at .5873 today.\nPrices scored a mildly bearish \""outside day\"" down on the daily bar\nchart today. The daily chart still looks\n\nbearish.\n\nDecember natural gas closed $0.177 higher at $3.36 today. \n\nPrices scored a fresh seven-week high today. Prices last\n\nweek pushed up above a longer-term downtrend line on the daily bar\nchart and today it was negated. \n\nSTOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The December Euro currency closed 125\npoints higher today at .9018. Bulls needed a day like today after the\nbears knocked them around recently. Bears remain in control. \n\nThe December Japanese yen closed up 52 points at .8218 today. Today\nsaw a rebound in a bear market and bears rule. Prices pushed to a\nthree-month low last week. \n\nThe December Swiss franc closed 91 points higher at .6134 today.\nBulls needed today after their recent whipping. A steep five-week-old\ndowntrend line on the daily bar chart was penetrated on the upside\nand negated today. \n\nThe December Canadian dollar closed 13 points higher at\n\n.6351 today. Bears still rule as prices are in a four-month-old\ndowntrend on the daily bar chart. \n\nThe December British pound closed up 164 points at 1.4486 today.\nToday's big gains negated a three-week-old downtrend line on the\ndaily bar chart and puts the bulls and bears back on a level playing\nfield, overall. \n\nThe September U.S. dollar index closed 119 points lower at\n\n114.71 today. Prices gapped lower on the daily bar chart today and\nthey closed near the session low. Technical damage was done with\ntoday's big downmove. \n\nDecember U.S. T-bonds closed 10/32 higher at 108 1/32. The\n\nbulls continue their push north as a new for-the-move\n\nhigh was set today. Prices are at lofty levels, but there is nothing\non the daily chart that suggests prices cannot go farther north. \n\nDecember S&P 500 futures closed off 28.50 at 1,073.50. Prices closed\nnear the session low today as trading has turned sideways and\nchoppier.

Prices dropped to a fresh contract low today on fund selling.\nThe market feels pressure from harvest and uninspired demand. After\ntoday's decline, I don't think there's much downside left in corn. \n\nJanuary soybeans closed unchanged at $4.34 1/4 today. More solid\nexport demand, in the form of strong weekly export inspections data\ntoday, failed to push the market higher. While prices could retest\nthe contract lows scored last week, or even drop below them, I do\nthink the downside from present price levels is limited. \n\nDecember Chicago SRW wheat closed off 3 3/4 cents at $2.91 1/4 today.\nPrices backed off today on some profit\n\ntaking from the recent gains, and no chart damage was done today.\nPrices Friday hit a fresh three-month high. \n\nSOFTS: March N.Y. sugar closed 5 points higher at 6.77 cents today.\nPrices closed near the session high. A fledging three-week-old\nuptrend line is still intact on the daily bar chart--but just barely.\nBears still have the technical edge, overall. \n\nDecember N.Y. coffee closed 25 points higher at 43.65 cents today.\nNot much fresh news. The bears are in full command of coffee at\npresent. The only encouraging news to the bulls is the recent\nincrease in volatility at these lower price levels. \n\nDecember N.Y. cocoa closed $2 higher today, at $997. There was enough\nfollow-through buying today to confirm a bullish key reversal on the\ndaily bar chart. \n\nDecember cotton closed 8 points higher at 28.94 cents in\n\nquiet trading today. Prices last week dropped down below key\nlong-term support at 29.50 cents. This opens the door to declines to\nthe 26-cent area, which is the lows seen in 1972, basis nearby\nfutures. \n\nJanuary orange juice on Friday afternoon closed at 90.65. That's up\n155 points from the Thursday evening close. Prices gapped higher\nFriday and bulls still have the big edge. \n\nMETALS: December COMEX gold futures closed up $1.40 at $279.70 an\nounce today. The weaker U.S. dollar helped the yellow metal today.\nPrices are still seeing a corrective bounce in a bear market, but\nbulls will take what they can get at present. \n\nDecember silver futures closed $0.028 higher at $4.243 an ounce\ntoday. Prices hit a fresh five-week low last week and bears have the\nbig edge. \n\nDecember N.Y. copper closed 40 points lower at 63.10 cents. Prices\nlast week dropped to a contract low of 62.00 cents. Bears rule.\n\nENERGIES: December crude closed $0.10 higher at $22.15 today. It was\na fairly quiet day. The daily chart still looks bearish. However, the\nlonger the market trades sideways, the more that favors the bulls and\nsome \""basing\"" activity. \n\nDecember heating oil closed 33 points higher at .6337 today. It was a\nquiet day today. The daily chart still looks bearish as prices hover\nnot that far above the recent lows. \n\nDecember unleaded gasoline closed 8 points lower at .5873 today.\nPrices scored a mildly bearish \""outside day\"" down on the daily bar\nchart today. The daily chart still looks\n\nbearish.\n\nDecember natural gas closed $0.177 higher at $3.36 today. \n\nPrices scored a fresh seven-week high today. Prices last\n\nweek pushed up above a longer-term downtrend line on the daily bar\nchart and today it was negated. \n\nSTOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The December Euro currency closed 125\npoints higher today at .9018. Bulls needed a day like today after the\nbears knocked them around recently. Bears remain in control. \n\nThe December Japanese yen closed up 52 points at .8218 today. Today\nsaw a rebound in a bear market and bears rule. Prices pushed to a\nthree-month low last week. \n\nThe December Swiss franc closed 91 points higher at .6134 today.\nBulls needed today after their recent whipping. A steep five-week-old\ndowntrend line on the daily bar chart was penetrated on the upside\nand negated today. \n\nThe December Canadian dollar closed 13 points higher at\n\n.6351 today. Bears still rule as prices are in a four-month-old\ndowntrend on the daily bar chart. \n\nThe December British pound closed up 164 points at 1.4486 today.\nToday's big gains negated a three-week-old downtrend line on the\ndaily bar chart and puts the bulls and bears back on a level playing\nfield, overall. \n\nThe September U.S. dollar index closed 119 points lower at\n\n114.71 today. Prices gapped lower on the daily bar chart today and\nthey closed near the session low. Technical damage was done with\ntoday's big downmove. \n\nDecember U.S. T-bonds closed 10/32 higher at 108 1/32. The\n\nbulls continue their push north as a new for-the-move\n\nhigh was set today. Prices are at lofty levels, but there is nothing\non the daily chart that suggests prices cannot go farther north. \n\nDecember S&P 500 futures closed off 28.50 at 1,073.50. Prices closed\nnear the session low today as trading has turned sideways and\nchoppier. Poor earnings reports, a weaker economic picture and an\nincreasing anthrax scare will limit upside moves. \n\nDaily Extreme Commentary is brought to you by GLOBALcharts, \nINO.com's end-of-day charting software for Futures, Futures \nOptions and Optionable Stocks. http://www.globalcharts.com\nSearch the INO Store  - http://store.ino.com/\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nI N O   N E W S   \n_____________________________________________________________________\n\n\nTwo Texas Men Sued For Defrauding Former Employer\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=27099\nCFTC  Extends Comment Periods On Security Futures Margins\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=27098\nLIFFE Recommends Euronext As Merger Partner\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=27097\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nE X T R E M E   F U T U R E S\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nUpdated every 10 minutes around the clock.\nMore at http://quotes.ino.com/analysis/extremes/futures/\n\nWINNERS\n\nNGX1   Henry Hub Natural Gas Nov 2001              3.202     0.209  +6.87\nLHG2   Lean Hogs Feb 2002                         52.300     1.875  +3.72\nXHZ1   Lean Hogs Dec 2001                          49.65      1.75  +3.66\nLBX2   Random Length Lumber Nov 2002              250.00      9.00  +3.60\nRAZ1   South African Rand Dec 2001              0.108000  0.002150  +2.03\nHOF3   Heating Oil Jan 2003                       0.6417    0.0111  +1.74\nXFZ1   Swiss Franc Dec 2001                       0.6145    0.0097  +1.60\nPBH2   Frozen Pork Bellies Mar 2002               67.150     1.050  +1.58\nSFZ1   Swiss Franc Dec 2001                      0.61350   0.00870  +1.44\nHUV2   New York Harbor Unleaded Gasoline Oct 20    0.6283    0.0089  +1.42\n\nLOSERS\n\nNDZ1   NASDAQ 100 Index Dec 2001                 1372.00    -79.50  -5.48\nZDZ1   Dow Jones Industrial Avg.

I pointed out the Section 542 of the bankruptcy code requires them to turn over property of the estate and our position is they don't have a valid lien.  I also indicated they were opening themselves up to damages for violation of the bankrupcty stay.  John indicated that since this issue (whether Article 7 of the UCC applies to natural gas storage)  would be a case of first impression they would be willing to litigate considering the amounts involved.  Summary - They are not willing to release the gas.  They are willing to release gas in excess of the amounts we owe to them, but only if stipulated that they are not waving their rights to assert the warehouseman's lien.  At this point it is probably better to get some gas and then decide whether to litigate the remainder.  Thoughts?  Stuart,  the answers to your questions are inserted below.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tZisman, Stuart  \nSent:\tFriday, January 11, 2002 11:02 AM\nTo:\tNemec, Gerald\nCc:\tRedmond, Brian; Parks, Joe\nSubject:\tBridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails\n\nI think we need to crystallize, in very short order, what the approval process will be for the sale of the Pad Gas in Storage Caverns #13/#14 to Bridgeline.  I will send you via fax the proposed deal sheet.\n\nSeveral interesting points from the meeting:\n\n1)  Bridgeline is of the view that 3/12/2002 (we thought it was 4/402) is the last day on which they are obligated to reimburse Enron for the Dow Lease - Any thoughts?  Who is right?; The contract states that they are obligated to reimburse through the earlier of July 1, 2002 or 114 days following the 4 BCF Date.  The 4 BCF date is defined at the day of the last Enron Pad Gas Payment.  The last Pad Gas Payment (for the month of November) was due on 12/10/01.  Thus, the 114 days should run from 12/10/01, which puts right around 4/4/02. \n\n2)  Their plan (assuming our deal goes through) is to amend and assume the existing lease - and get Dow to expressly release LRCI from any and all claims/liabilities/etc. following Bridgeline's assumption of the amended lease; This approach sounds reasonable. \n\n3)  Bridgeline indicated that Dow is of the opinion that approximately $167k is owed by Enron for dewatering brine removal fees ($0.20 per ton of salt removed) - I need your help to determine whether this is accurate; I don't see any basis for this in the agreement.  The $0.20 per ton of salt removed fee, refers to barrels of capacity being created in the Cavern #1.  This is related to the leaching operation.  If the fee is related to the leaching operation, then they might be correct. (Accounting would need to verify their numbers though).  If they are seeking a fee for brine removal during degassing, I don't think they have a basis for this fee.  We need to understand their basis for the claim.  \n\n4)  Bridgeline is desirous of having Cavern #1 (along with the various rights-of-way) conveyed sooner rather than later (and wondered whether we could expedite the approval process on this part of the deal).  I don't know what the advantages/disadvantages there are to this but would love your input along with your thoughts on whether this is feasible or not; We have until July 1, 2002 to convey the Cavern #1.  To the extent we wanted to wait to wrap up all our issues and convey at that time, we are not harmed under the Partnership agreement.  Obviously we retain any risks associated with ownership of the cavern. \n\n5)  We indicated that we thought the approval process would take approximately 30 days from the day that we reached what we believed were mutually agreeable terms with Bridgeline (does this sound right?) - The goal is to be done no later than March 1, 2002; and I think this sounds reasonable. \n\n6)  Eric Booth is going to call Robert Morgan to get the support for the $550k of expenses relating to the dewatering line and the flowline.\n\nStuart"", ""Stuart,  I reviewed the Bridgeline binders.  I found a side letter agreement that addresses termination of the Transport and Storage Agreement.  Basically the letter provides LD's payable by ENA to Bridgeline for early termination.  Bridgeline get's kept whole for the intitial ten year term of the agreements.  For the transport deal, they get $0.025 for 150,000 MMBtu per day for the remaining ten year period and for the storage deal they receive $0.025 for 100,000 MMBtu per day for the remaining ten year period.  Both are NPV'd at a discount rate of 9%.  The side letter and the transport and storage agreements have no provisions affecting the Partnership upon early termination of those agreements.  I am researching the common carrier order and will get back later today.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tZisman, Stuart  \nSent:\tWednesday, January 02, 2002 4:38 PM\nTo:\tMcMichael Jr., Ed; Nemec, Gerald\nCc:\tRedmond, Brian\nSubject:\tBridgeline Partnership and Storage/Transportation Deals\n\nEd and Gerald,\n\nBrian and I spoke with Randy Curry of Bridgeline earlier today regarding a deal that we are trying to put together in order to sell the pad gas (in place) from Storage Caverns #13/#14.  During that conversation, Randy indicated that: (i) ENA's default under its storage and transport agreements with Bridgeline impacts the Bridgeline partnership itself (and that there are certain side agreements that spell this out) and (ii) Bridgeline would reject any efforts by ENA to remove its gas inventories from storage facilities owned by Bridgeline.  Bridgeline contends that ENA is permitted to pay all past due amounts and provide adequate assurances for future payment on its storage and transport deals as there is a bankruptcy order in place that allows the debtors to pay common carrier liens and warehouseman's liens.  I asked Randy whether he had sought a lawyer's opinion regarding whether Bridgeline could be properly classified as a common carrier and/or warehouseman - he said that he had.\n\nGerald please advise regarding Randy's assertions above.\n\nEd, please let me know if you are already looking into either of these matters.

VARGAS \nCopyright 2002 Houston Chronicle \nIsn't it just like Houston to go for seconds? \nThis title-craving city has been named the fattest, plumpest, most rotund city in America by Men's Fitness for a second consecutive year. \nWeigh to go. \nFattest cities 1. Houston 2. Chicago 3. Detroit 4. Philadelphia 5. Dallas 6. Columbus, Ohio 7. San Antonio 8. Fort Worth 9. St. Louis 10. Indianapolis Fittest cities 1. Colorado Springs, Colo. 2. Denver 3. San Diego 4. Seattle 5. San Francisco 6. Virginia Beach, Va. 7. Honolulu 8. Sacramento, Calif. 9. Albuquerque, N.M. 10. Boston \t\n\""Houstonians need to turn off the TV and get out to their parks where a variety of programs for kids and adults are offered for free,\"" the magazine writes. \nLast year, Houstonians viewed the national magazine as a svelte bully picking on the chubby little kid on the playground and reacted like a protective, angry mother. \nIn 2002, the message is soaking in like a juicy, half-pound hamburger patty on a freshly toasted bun. \n\""The first year we were kind of upset because we weren't happy or agreed with the ranking because they took into account air quality and other things people can't control,\"" says Shadston Pittman, fitness coordinator for the city's Parks and Recreation Department. \""This year the ranking is motivating because we have some projects in place now. I think we can show the world (weight loss) is a priority for us. \n\""But they still got us. Again.\"" \nIn fact, Pittman thought Indianapolis would get the top honor. Sorry, they came in 10th. \n\""I didn't think we'd be number one because of the proactive steps we took,\"" he says. \nFor the country's 50 largest cities, the magazine took existing data and issued grades in 16 categories such as overweight and obesity rates (D), air quality (F), TV viewing habits (F), water quality (D), parks and open space (D+), nutrition (B-) and climate (C). \nWhen the grades were tallied, Houston once again found itself at the head of the class, albeit the one with all the detention-serving kids. \nThe Men's Fitness issue hits newsstands Tuesday. (Meanwhile, we apparently should hit the treadmill.) \nNot to be outdone, other major Texas cities also found themselves on the heavy side. \nDallas ranked fifth. San Antonio was seventh. Fort Worth ranked eighth and El Paso weighed in at 14th. \nThe only Texas city on the light side was Austin, ranked as the 16th fittest. The fittest city was Colorado Springs, Colo. \nKaren Calabro, coordinator of health promotion and health education at the University of Texas-Houston Health Science Center, says although she doesn't put much stock into the magazine's formula, Houstonians could stand to shed a few pounds. \n\""We could all lose some weight. Me included,\"" the registered dietitian says. \nHouston, Calabro says, isn't the only city with a caloric-intake and sedentary epidemic. \nNationally, 55 percent of adults are overweight or obese, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. \nAs your waistline expands so do your chances of developing diseases or conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease or diabetes, Calabro says. \n\""A big part of this obesity problem,\"" she says, \""is that we're not exercising\"" -- not even when the opportunity presents itself for a brisk walk. \nWe opt for the elevator when the stairs call our name. We see escalators as our new best friend. And we drive to the corner store for ice cream. \nBut Pittman hopes to alter our lifestyles and ballooning image. \nAfter Houston earned the first unsolicited title, Pittman and two other city officials visited Philadelphia, which owned the \""fattest\"" ranking in 2000. \nPhilly started a citywide campaign called \""Fun, Fit and Free\"" to get its residents to slim down. Last year, Philadelphia fell out of the top spot and this year is in fourth place. \nPittman, who is also a personal trainer and has been fitness coordinator for just a year, says Houston's version will not be under one umbrella slogan like Philadelphia's. However, there will be several endeavors to involve as many people as possible. \nThe city's get-fit effort will kick off Jan. 17 when the city teams up with the Subway sandwich chain to bring the Subway Challenge to Houston. \nThe problem is so serious that Subway is sending its big-gun spokesman to the Jan. 17 event. \nFrom 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. outside City Hall, 900 Smith, participants can meet Jared Fogle, who lost 245 pounds on a diet of low-fat, low-calorie Subway sandwiches, and receive a pledge card good for sandwich discounts and a two-week free membership to Bally Total Fitness. \n\""That Jared's a nice guy,\"" Pittman says. \""That's his full-time job now.\"" \nPeople would agree that losing weight is a full-time task. \nThe city will also team up with the Texas Fruit and Produce Growers Association and Central Market to promote the \""Five a Day\"" message of eating five serving of fruits and vegetables a day. That effort kicks off Jan. 22. \n\""We're not saying everyone has to run 10 miles a day around Memorial Park,\"" Pittman says. \""We're talking just simple lifestyle changes.\"" \nLater this year, Houston will join other major Texas cities in a program called \""Shape Up Texas\"" to improve health and wellness among Texans. That's not a bad idea considering Texas cities make up 20 percent of the fat list and four of the top eight. \nMayor Lee Brown says he will do his part to cut out the fat at City Hall. \nBrown, who has put on a few pounds since taking office, says he isn't surprised by Houston's expansive reputation. \n\""I'm afraid I've contributed to that,\"" he says. \nBrown says he will set an example for the rest of the city by losing some weight himself, not through a diet but by walking and riding his bike more. However, he wouldn't reveal how much weight he planned to shed. \nPittman applauds the mayor's words about weight loss. \n\""It's great when you have someone of that stature visibly being a speaker for health and fitness,\"" he says. \nThe last thing we want is a three-peat in 2003.

I have received assurances from the two of you, Oxley, and Greg at different times as to the security of the comp received.  The messages generally start with \""it's safe,\"" \""don't worry about it,\"" \""all comp paid in 2001 advanced the interest of shareholders and the estate,\"" \""low probability that there will be any issues,\"" ....  At other times, particularly when you want me to commit to this deal, the logic changes.  The comp paid in 2001 becomes risky and will become a whole lot safer if I'm on the team.  While I recognize that Enron is a very strange and fluid place these days, it appears that at times the story changes depending on what you want me to do.\n\nWhen I ask for indemnification on comp paid to me in 2001 the answer is that it is off the table -- a non-starter.  Why?  \nBecause the estate is negotiating the deal.  Then have them negotiate that on behalf of me.\nBecause the buyer has no interest in legacy issues with the estate.  I wouldn't be here but for the legacy issues with the estate -- it is definitely the buyer's issue!\nBecause people have too much to do to get this deal done to take the time to negotiate with each employee.  I am available at any time wherever you want me to be to discuss this matter if and when the estate/the buyer have time.\nBecause we don't know who from the buyer to negotiate with.  Someone from the buyer has to decide on comp and contract issues -- why not figure it out now.\nBecause this deal is bigger than Tim Belden.  I'm not delusional.  I know that this is a big deal with a lot of moving parts.  If it's bigger than me then it will likely move forward without me.\n\n\nSince I am not \""on the team\"" right now, I am also working with a great deal less information than you have.  I respect your choice to differentiate the information disseminated to people \""on the team\"" versus not \""on the team.\""  However, the consequences of that choice provide less information to me which creates a greater leap of faith in my mind.  For example, I have no idea how the mechanics of getting these options done, conveyed to the creditors/buyer/estate/judge works.  Louise inidicated that it would be a memo or some form of written document indicating the people and total dollars needed to secure them.  If that's the case, you could add my indemnification amount (adjusted by probability of payout) to that total and it surely wouldn't blow up the deal.  Unless, the probability of payout is high.\n\nFurthermore, I am not proposing that we change the basic employment doc (subject to comment from my lawyer, but I'll try to keep immaterial changes to a minimum).  I am saying that a condition precedent for me is to negotiate a separate indemnification doc with the buyer.  At that point in time, I would hope that they have the time and the inclination to discuss such a doc.  Perhaps at that time, some of the 2001 comp issues will already be cleared through the bankruptcy judge making the discussion that much easier.  Based on various discussions with the two of you over the last couple of weeks I have been led to believe that such a decision is expected and perhaps imminent.  I don't understand why this is a non-starter issue, but I don't have the same information that you do.\n\nTo be clear, here is the basic deal that I am willing to offer as a free option to the buyer:\nthe deal as it exists plus\nretention payments for those still with the company who deserve them who have not yet received them.\nindemnification of 2001 comp up to $4 million.\n\nI expect that the two of you will tell me that I'm not on the team, that 800 people are going home, and that the Portland office will be moved to Houston if this thing survives.  That is not what I want to happen.  If this deal is bigger than me then those things shouldn't happen.  I have given this a lot of thought over the last couple of days and came up with my conclusions.  I am open to any productive discussions that you would like to have.\n\nIn talking through this stuff with Mike and Matt I realize what a hard position you guys are in.  I feel that I have lost ground rather than gain ground with them in the last couple of days.  I trust that you are trying to do the right thing.  There are just so many things that are uncertain right now that it makes it very difficult for me to give away the option that you have requested without firming up some other issues for me at the same time.  \n\nFinally, I apologize for hanging up on Louise ealier.  It's probably better than me hearing what she was about to say and her hearing what I was about to say.  I will call to see that you received and read this e-mail.  I am comfortable with whatever you decide to do.\n\nTim"", ""Did the numbers that we gave you yesterday on Operations hold up after your meeting with UBS?\n\nAmy Fitzpatrick is calling me to get names.

(100% owned)\n                    Enron American del Sur, S.A.  is an Enron Corp./Enron Transportation Services entity\n                    No entity called Enron Singapore .... more than likely Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company.\n \nEIM:         No Stadacona Paper Company but it  is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM \n                Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp. as the general partner and a list of Limited\n                Partners including ENA, Enron Corp. and a non-Enron entity (Salomon Brothers Holding Company, Inc.)\n \nENW:        Enron Net Works, LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp. company\n \nEWC:        The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp. which is owned by Smith Street Land Co., an Enron Corp. company, but many of the \n                 names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list.   For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas, S.A.; \n                 no Enron Wind UK, no Enron Wind India .... but regardless, they are all part of the EWC/EREC family.\n \nGLOBAL    These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration & Production, Inc., which is owned by Enron Corp., but one has indirect outside ownership.\n EP:           Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd., for instance, is owned by Enron Asst Holdings, which is owned by Enron Finance Partners, which is part of a complex ownership\n                 structure that includes one non-Enron entity (Zephyrus Investments, LLC) with a small interest.      \n                    \nAgain, I hope this information is helpful.  For the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track.

We need complete well characteristic data (depth, basin, age) in order to be accurate.  \n\nIn order to reach the goal above, we need to invest in two data services from IHS:\n\n\tUS Production data - monthly volumes from all wells in the US updated on a lag of 1-6 months - $159,500/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly\n\tUS Well data - well characteristics updated monthly, data age is only limited by CD-ROM delivery - $154,000/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly\n\nNext year, we will be able to cut the US Well data and add Scout Express, which will cut the cost by $115,500.  Scout Express has only one year of historical well data, so it does not currently meet our needs.  We will be able to do this after we build the historical well information into our supply forecast.\n\nDanielle Marcinkowski is working with IHS on the contract for the data, she is going to try and negotiate the price this afternoon.

I hate to suggest it but do you need to reduce the people allowed to take risk for the Company? (similar to what was done when we sold HPL).  The general feeling is that everyone at the top is taking care of themselves and the \""little\"" people that have been making the money for the Company are left out in the cold.

Before I turn to the organizational=\n changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t=\nhe company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are b=\ny their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of t=\nhis group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had =\nthat responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re=\nsponsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven=\n by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat=\ned group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also =\nvery decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is =\nnot easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor=\nk, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we =\nshared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=\n have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=\n are leaving for all you have done.\n\nAs to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =\nme that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=\nctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =\nability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.

Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=\ndership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=\nty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =\nbe led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.

Paul=\n will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=\nelopment efforts across the U.S.\n\nMuch of the rest of the group remains the same.

(The tabs total 184 with one Associate noted on a separate line in Power Logistics, and 183 without that Associate, so I don't know whether you are using 183 or 184 currently for the Operations total.) Taking this number to 100 in total is obviously a big change - 45.6% reduction.  At this moment, I don't know how feasible that is.  But I will work with Jeff, Stacey and Leslie to find out.\n \nWe  need some questions answered first to go through this:\n \n1)  Who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for Gas and Power Logistics?  Together, those groups represent 25% of the 184 headcount.  Going in, I would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions - should be 21 reductions.  We need to know who we should work with to coordinate this.  Need names and weekend contact numbers.\n \n2)  What will the overall headcount be for Netco?  What we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes.  If commercial numbers don't change and the business scope doesn't change, a 45.6% reduction is probably out of the question.  \n \n3)  Is the 100 number for Operations only a start-up number?  Could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up, approval is obtained for physical gas business, etc.?  Or is the 100 number intended to be the total headcount for all of 2002?\n \n4)  What are UBS' expectations for mid and back office?  What are the views from Legal and UBS on creating confirmations for EOL transactions?  There were some discussions with Leslie Reeves about not confirming certain types of transactions.  One firm, and I don't remember whether it was UBS or not, mentioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions, and that instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations.  That is a completely different activity than we normally engage in, and would make a difference in staffing - perhaps requiring more people!   We need to know those things from UBS to take a real stab at a revised number.  Should we just pool our knowledge from various discussions that have been had with UBS, or is there someone with UBS that we should be talking with this weekend to get there view of what is required?\n \n5)  Does the internal RAC group go forward under a headcount reduction - i.e. will we be coordinating and providing information to them, or will UBS assume some of their functions?  This may impact our staffing needs.  What about consolidated risk reporting - will Stacey and Jeff simply transmit data to UBS, or Netco have to provide some consolidated risk reporting before sending info to UBS?\n \nWe may have more questions, but these are key now to get at a feasible number.  \n \n--Sally \n "", ""damn, thought you forgot\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Lavorato, John \nSent: Monday, October 15, 2001 12:15 PM\nTo: Arnold, John\nSubject: RE: \n\n\nplus 50 for the minni bet 185\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Arnold, John \nSent: Monday, October 15, 2001 11:16 AM\nTo: Lavorato, John\nSubject: RE: \n\n\n5-3-2\n+255 - 120 = 135 your way\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Lavorato, John \nSent: Saturday, October 13, 2001 9:25 AM\nTo: Arnold, John\nSubject: \n\n\ni owe you 120 - wow\n \nall 150\n \nbalt -1\ntb +3\nchic/ariz over 39.5\ncar +5\ngiants +11 \nsd +3\nsf -3\nmiami -3\nseattle +6.5\noak +3.5\n "", ""The data is the most accurate data on field receipts and well completions in the US.

It is our intent to use the monthly historical production data in combination with well completion data, rig counts, and drilling permits to build a more accurate production forecast.  We need complete well characteristic data (depth, basin, age) in order to be accurate.  \n\nIn order to reach the goal above, we need to invest in two data services from IHS:\n\n\tUS Production data - monthly volumes from all wells in the US updated on a lag of 1-6 months - $159,500/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly\n\tUS Well data - well characteristics updated monthly, data age is only limited by CD-ROM delivery - $154,000/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly\n\nNext year, we will be able to cut the US Well data and add Scout Express, which will cut the cost by $115,500.  Scout Express has only one year of historical well data, so it does not currently meet our needs.  We will be able to do this after we build the historical well information into our supply forecast.\n\nDanielle Marcinkowski is working with IHS on the contract for the data, she is going to try and negotiate the price this afternoon.

Uncomfortable with UBS's committment to the business\n\t\t2. Surprised that no one from UBS has spoken directly with him\n\t\t3. Seems like he wants to build/run a team and is motivated by money.\n\t\t4. His interperetation of the contract is that even if this deal fails, his would be bound by a none compete until the end.\n\n\tSolution:  Money alone is not enough because does not address 1 and 2.  He needs someone (senior) from UBS to spend some time with him to:\n\t\t   (a) help him fell more comfortable with UBS's committment; (b) get him excited by the possiblity to lead/shape/direct the weather group\n\t\t   (this notion seemed to catch his interest during our discussion with him); (c) and present him with a new deal (no more of this aim for 80%\n\t\t   happy bullshit).  This new deal will need considerably less restrictive language--talk with Hunter about specifics.\n\nAdam:\tIssue:  1. Has interest in returing to the air force (his window to do so is until July 7th.)\n\n\tSolution:  Appears that money is not his first priority.  Any offer of money that precludes him from the July 7th window will be unsuccessful!\n\t\t   Our strategy needs to be one that gives him some respectable money that he can keep as long as he stays until June 1st (after he is\n\t\t   committed it may be possible to persuade him to stay longer).  He will not accept an offer that takes away his air force option!!!!!!  Also,\n\t\t   I think signing him will be alot easier once others have committed.\n\nJose:\tIssue:\t1.

We were told that star performers will be retained.  At what profit level do we become star performers?\n\nI understand you and your staff have a tremendous number of things that need to be accomplished.  As I talk with my peers, the most important thing on our minds is if we will have a job and what we will be paid.  John was saying that in a few months this issue would be addressed.  My immediate concern is to secure employment while there are still positions available with other companies.  I will accept the first lucrative offer that is made to me.  My peers have expressed the same sentiment.  In a few months, there may not be any jobs left.   We have to may hay while the sun shines.  We all have been bombarded with calls from executive search firms.  We are all racing for a limited number of jobs that promise substantially higher salaries.\n\nWhat we need on this floor is some assurances.  Maybe it should be in the form of granting bonuses now and offering employment contracts.  We need some exact numbers in the form of dates, salaries, and bonus plans. \n\nScott Neal brought up this same question several times and John said he understood how critical this situation is.

Before I turn to the organizational=\n changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t=\nhe company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are b=\ny their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of t=\nhis group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had =\nthat responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re=\nsponsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven=\n by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat=\ned group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also =\nvery decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is =\nnot easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor=\nk, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we =\nshared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=\n have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=\n are leaving for all you have done.\n\nAs to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =\nme that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=\nctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =\nability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee=\nd to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all =\nU.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, =\nJim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j=\nointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of =\nthe group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h=\nelp Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=\ndership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=\nty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =\nbe led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La=\nst, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o=\nn California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part=\n of the Wholesale electricity team).\n\nSteve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =\ndevelopment effort along with Dan Allegretti.\n\nWith the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=\n a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=\nislative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=\nill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=\n will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=\nelopment efforts across the U.S.\n\nMuch of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti=\nnue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, =\ntaking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi=\nm will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con=\ntinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over su=\npport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market=\ns, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue=\n to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government=\n affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout=\nh America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts=\n, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.\n\nI am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs =\nto provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Comm=\nittee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman,=\n Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord=\n, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also con=\ntinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry King=\nerski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am form=\ning a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of =\nJose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself=\n.\n\nNo organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf=\nect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more pre=\npared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as th=\ne future unfolds for the company.\n\nOne final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through =\nthis uncertain and troubled period for the company.  We are all saddened by=\n the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr=\noup fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each othe=\nr and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, f=\nor those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excelle=\nnce and integrity that has characterized our group.  Personally, I will do =\nall I can, for as long as I can, to steer the group through this to the ver=\ny best place possible.  Your continued dedication and support is very much =\nappreciated.  Hang in there and thanks.\n\n"", ""I am assuming one of you comes initially - you or Bob.  We don't mind someone coming later but do need someone in at the beginning.

I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.

(actually comes up to Corp. through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance)\n \nEEOS:        Enron Engineering & Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp.\n                   The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd. whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe.  \n \nEES:           Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity\n                    The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities Services/Limbach companies\n \nEGA:         Here's where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with \n                 complicated, multi-layers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp. ownership.  As you know all of the old subsets (i.e. APACHI, CALME, etc.) have\n                 gone away and everything international is now EGA.    To the best of our knowledge, all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed.\n                 Following are the exceptions and/or unusual organizational structure that should be noted:\n                    Electricidad Enron de Guatemala S.A. actually reports up through ENA\n                    San Juan Gas Company, Inc. in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp. (100% owned)\n                    Enron American del Sur, S.A.  is an Enron Corp./Enron Transportation Services entity\n                    No entity called Enron Singapore .... more than likely Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company.\n \nEIM:         No Stadacona Paper Company but it  is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM \n                Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp. as the general partner and a list of Limited\n                Partners including ENA, Enron Corp. and a non-Enron entity (Salomon Brothers Holding Company, Inc.)\n \nENW:        Enron Net Works, LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp. company\n \nEWC:        The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp. which is owned by Smith Street Land Co., an Enron Corp. company, but many of the \n                 names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list.   For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas, S.A.; \n                 no Enron Wind UK, no Enron Wind India .... but regardless, they are all part of the EWC/EREC family.\n \nGLOBAL    These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration & Production, Inc., which is owned by Enron Corp., but one has indirect outside ownership.\n EP:           Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd., for instance, is owned by Enron Asst Holdings, which is owned by Enron Finance Partners, which is part of a complex ownership\n                 structure that includes one non-Enron entity (Zephyrus Investments, LLC) with a small interest.      \n                    \nAgain, I hope this information is helpful.  For the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track.  Let my group know if we can be of additional assistance.\n \nHardie\n \nAngus H.

The estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that may result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter.  \n\nYour desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible.

It is expected to cost about $146 million. The Mexican government already has issued a transportation permit to Sempra Energy International to build the 135-mile Mexican portion, Gasoducto Baja norte, to Mexicali, Baja California. \nFERC's approval came after the FERC staff, and the staffs of the California State Lands Commission and the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management issued a favorable final environmental impact statement. The Commission already had issued a preliminary determination, approving all non-environmental aspects of the project. \nIf the project \""is constructed as modified and in accordance with [North Baja 's] proposed mitigation and our recommendations, it would be an environmentally acceptable action,\"" the staffs of the three agencies concluded in the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on the pipeline (CP01-22). \nThe pipeline could be delivering gas to the first of two new power plants in Mexicali as early as mid-summer.

Given this we need to make some decisions as to how to best handle these=\n services agreements.  Here are some suggestions:\n\nPeggy Hedstrom, in Calgary would like to assign the Enron Canada Master Ser=\nvices agreements to NETCO and continue to service those via that entity.\n\nBridgeline, which is a JV in which ENA owns a 40% interest, currently has n=\no way that they can support themselves.  They are totally dependent on Enro=\nn for everything from email, internet, network services and office applicat=\nions as well as trading, risk and back office applications.  If there are c=\noncerns about the estate's ability to support Bridgeline then it may be in =\nEnron's best interest to assign this agreement to NETCO.\n\nAEP/HPL is more of a stand alone operation.  They have their own infrastruc=\nture in place and currently provide for their own email and office support =\nservices.  They have also brought up with their own version of our SCADA sy=\nstem and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our =\nPipeline Operations system.  If we sell them our version of PGAS to support=\n their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications =\ninto their own Trade Blotter, Open Link Financials and Altra.  Their goal w=\nas to try and have all of this in place by sometime in June of this year.  =\nGiven all of the Commercial conflicts with AEP regarding the sale of HPL it=\n may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and sugges=\nt that AEP try to be stand alone ASAP.  That way if the estate defaults on =\nthe service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information fro=\nm one system to another until they have put in their own integration betwee=\nn the applications listed above.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any comments or if it makes sense to put tog=\nether a meeting to discuss the issues of Service Agreements.\n\n =20\n\nTommy J Yanowski\nSr. Director - Enron Net Works\nWork # 713.853.6858\nCell # 713.539.7094\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Perlman, Beth =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, December 19, 2001 3:54 PM\nTo:=09Johnson, Jeff; Stock, Steve; McAuliffe, Bob\nCc:=09Webb, Jay; Yanowski, Tommy J.; Burchfield, Richard\nSubject:=09RE: Integration Test Planning / Coordination Mtg Summary\n\nThe AEP and Bridgeline deals must be investigated.

This assumes all major production data setup - users, rights, books=\n, global data - is completed and tested on a per application basis. Some co=\nde changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ens=\nure the applications still talk to each other.=20\n3) Integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactio=\nns from EOL to SAP through all core trading applications to ensure that app=\nlications and interfaces still work. We will not be testing functional perm=\nutations, data conditions, validation or exceptions to any significant degr=\nee.=20\n4) Each application conversion team must test their changes before approvin=\ng their changes for integration testing. We are operating from the premise =\nthat data, infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a applicatio=\nn system level before the enterprise integration test starts.=20\n4) All systems will be physically split (even Unify at this point).=20\n5) Integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both Es=\ntate and New Co.=20\n6) We will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and ex=\necution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to=\n support go live to production.=20\n7) We will minimize the differentiation between New Co and Estate for conve=\nrsion and test team purposes. There are two teams - Conversion and Integrat=\nion Test. Each team will focus on both Estate and New Co. Resources are too=\n tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility.=20\n8) Estate conversions must happen at the application level before New Co co=\nnversion work can begin in earnest. Estate conversion is on the critical pa=\nth for New Co.=20\n\n\nKey Issues\n1) We will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial tradi=\nng first, then physical. If financial is the focus, delivery risk goes down=\n dramatically. For now, we must plan on the worst case -- physical and fina=\nncial on Jan 20.=20\n2) We need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support A=\nEP and Bridgeline in Estate. This means that we need a dev environment (and=\n HW gap addressed) for Unify, Sitara, CPR, TAGG/ERMS. Conversion teams need=\n to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure w=\ne're in synch.=20\n3) Unify servers probably can't be owned by New Co while running a single l=\nicense of Unify.=20\n4) Some systems are using 'short name' instead of Duns ID as a key for coun=\nterparties from Global. The Global, TAGG / ERMS, Unify and SAP reps must qu=\nickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizin=\ng hard coded reference id risks.=20\n5) We must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these =\npotential dates. We must focus on core systems with only core changes requi=\nred to support day one trading.=20\n6) We can only convert Estate over the weekend due to AEP / Bridgeline cons=\niderations. The time window will be very small.=20\n\n\nCore Conversion Team =20\n1) Steve Stock - Applications\n2) Bob McAuliffe - Infrastructure\n3) Ziyong Wei\n4) Steve Nat\n5) Dave Nommensen\n6) Ken Harmon\n7) John Warner\n8) Bob Ward\n....\n\nCore Integration Test Team=20\n1) Jeff Johnson\n2) Iain Greig\n3) Aftab Saleem\n4) Terry Sanvido\n5) Regan Smith\n\nProgram Coordination=20\n1) Jane Henry\n2) Steve Simpson\n\nNext Steps For Integration Test Team\n1) Due 12/20.

I am genuinely trying to be as reasonable as possible.  I am not trying to \""hold up\"" the deal at the last minute.  I'm afraid that I am being asked to take a fairly large leap of faith after this company (I don't mean the two of you -- I mean Enron) has screwed me and the people who work for me.\n\nI am generally ok with the concept of the option, the doc, and comp parameters.  In addition, I need assurances that 90 day retentions will be paid to the people we have identified who deserve them and haven't received them and I need to know that the comp conveyed to me in 2001 is secure. \n\nIt is unlikely that I would be here today if it weren't for the collective comp conveyed to me during 2001.  I have received assurances from the two of you, Oxley, and Greg at different times as to the security of the comp received.  The messages generally start with \""it's safe,\"" \""don't worry about it,\"" \""all comp paid in 2001 advanced the interest of shareholders and the estate,\"" \""low probability that there will be any issues,\"" ....  At other times, particularly when you want me to commit to this deal, the logic changes.  The comp paid in 2001 becomes risky and will become a whole lot safer if I'm on the team.  While I recognize that Enron is a very strange and fluid place these days, it appears that at times the story changes depending on what you want me to do.\n\nWhen I ask for indemnification on comp paid to me in 2001 the answer is that it is off the table -- a non-starter.  Why?  \nBecause the estate is negotiating the deal.  Then have them negotiate that on behalf of me.\nBecause the buyer has no interest in legacy issues with the estate.  I wouldn't be here but for the legacy issues with the estate -- it is definitely the buyer's issue!\nBecause people have too much to do to get this deal done to take the time to negotiate with each employee.  I am available at any time wherever you want me to be to discuss this matter if and when the estate/the buyer have time.\nBecause we don't know who from the buyer to negotiate with.  Someone from the buyer has to decide on comp and contract issues -- why not figure it out now.\nBecause this deal is bigger than Tim Belden.  I'm not delusional.  I know that this is a big deal with a lot of moving parts.  If it's bigger than me then it will likely move forward without me.\n\n\nSince I am not \""on the team\"" right now, I am also working with a great deal less information than you have.  I respect your choice to differentiate the information disseminated to people \""on the team\"" versus not \""on the team.\""  However, the consequences of that choice provide less information to me which creates a greater leap of faith in my mind.  For example, I have no idea how the mechanics of getting these options done, conveyed to the creditors/buyer/estate/judge works.  Louise inidicated that it would be a memo or some form of written document indicating the people and total dollars needed to secure them.  If that's the case, you could add my indemnification amount (adjusted by probability of payout) to that total and it surely wouldn't blow up the deal.  Unless, the probability of payout is high.\n\nFurthermore, I am not proposing that we change the basic employment doc (subject to comment from my lawyer, but I'll try to keep immaterial changes to a minimum).  I am saying that a condition precedent for me is to negotiate a separate indemnification doc with the buyer.  At that point in time, I would hope that they have the time and the inclination to discuss such a doc.  Perhaps at that time, some of the 2001 comp issues will already be cleared through the bankruptcy judge making the discussion that much easier.  Based on various discussions with the two of you over the last couple of weeks I have been led to believe that such a decision is expected and perhaps imminent.  I don't understand why this is a non-starter issue, but I don't have the same information that you do.\n\nTo be clear, here is the basic deal that I am willing to offer as a free option to the buyer:\nthe deal as it exists plus\nretention payments for those still with the company who deserve them who have not yet received them.\nindemnification of 2001 comp up to $4 million.\n\nI expect that the two of you will tell me that I'm not on the team, that 800 people are going home, and that the Portland office will be moved to Houston if this thing survives.  That is not what I want to happen.  If this deal is bigger than me then those things shouldn't happen.  I have given this a lot of thought over the last couple of days and came up with my conclusions.  I am open to any productive discussions that you would like to have.\n\nIn talking through this stuff with Mike and Matt I realize what a hard position you guys are in.  I feel that I have lost ground rather than gain ground with them in the last couple of days.  I trust that you are trying to do the right thing.  There are just so many things that are uncertain right now that it makes it very difficult for me to give away the option that you have requested without firming up some other issues for me at the same time.  \n\nFinally, I apologize for hanging up on Louise ealier.  It's probably better than me hearing what she was about to say and her hearing what I was about to say.  I will call to see that you received and read this e-mail.  I am comfortable with whatever you decide to do.\n\nTim"", ""Have a look at this.  We would need to sign tomorrow.

APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  \n\nAs to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (\""RECs\""), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. \n\nTrading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.

Listed on that matrix include factors such as job criticality (which is weighted to be twice as significant as any of the other factors), ability to perform several different types of jobs, business knowledge, leadership, teamwork, and historical performance over the last 18 months.  PRC results would not be the sole factor.  Otherwise, someone who is the only person who knows how to do a mission-critical job might be affected simply because he rated out lower at mid-year review.

There are a few, however, that may be incorrectly categorized, as follows:\n \nEA:             ECT Non U.S. Payroll Company (there is no such entity, but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA)\n                   Enron Capital & Trade Resources in London, UK  (may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited)\n \nEBS:           Broadband Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (actually comes up to Corp. through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance)\n \nEEOS:        Enron Engineering & Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp.\n                   The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd. whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe.  \n \nEES:           Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity\n                    The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities Services/Limbach companies\n \nEGA:         Here's where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with \n                 complicated, multi-layers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp. ownership.  As you know all of the old subsets (i.e. APACHI, CALME, etc.) have\n                 gone away and everything international is now EGA.    To the best of our knowledge, all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed.\n                 Following are the exceptions and/or unusual organizational structure that should be noted:\n                    Electricidad Enron de Guatemala S.A. actually reports up through ENA\n                    San Juan Gas Company, Inc. in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp. (100% owned)\n                    Enron American del Sur, S.A.  is an Enron Corp./Enron Transportation Services entity\n                    No entity called Enron Singapore .... more than likely Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company.\n \nEIM:         No Stadacona Paper Company but it  is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM \n                Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp. as the general partner and a list of Limited\n                Partners including ENA, Enron Corp. and a non-Enron entity (Salomon Brothers Holding Company, Inc.)\n \nENW:        Enron Net Works, LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp. company\n \nEWC:        The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp. which is owned by Smith Street Land Co., an Enron Corp. company, but many of the \n                 names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list.   For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas, S.A.; \n                 no Enron Wind UK, no Enron Wind India .... but regardless, they are all part of the EWC/EREC family.\n \nGLOBAL    These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration & Production, Inc., which is owned by Enron Corp., but one has indirect outside ownership.\n EP:           Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd., for instance, is owned by Enron Asst Holdings, which is owned by Enron Finance Partners, which is part of a complex ownership\n                 structure that includes one non-Enron entity (Zephyrus Investments, LLC) with a small interest.      \n                    \nAgain, I hope this information is helpful.

APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  \n\nAs to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (\""RECs\""), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. \n\nTrading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.

Before I turn to the organizational=\n changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t=\nhe company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are b=\ny their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of t=\nhis group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had =\nthat responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re=\nsponsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven=\n by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat=\ned group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also =\nvery decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is =\nnot easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor=\nk, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we =\nshared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=\n have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=\n are leaving for all you have done.\n\nAs to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =\nme that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=\nctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =\nability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee=\nd to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all =\nU.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, =\nJim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j=\nointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of =\nthe group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h=\nelp Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=\ndership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=\nty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =\nbe led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La=\nst, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o=\nn California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part=\n of the Wholesale electricity team).\n\nSteve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =\ndevelopment effort along with Dan Allegretti.\n\nWith the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=\n a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=\nislative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=\nill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=\n will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=\nelopment efforts across the U.S.\n\nMuch of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti=\nnue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, =\ntaking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi=\nm will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con=\ntinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over su=\npport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market=\ns, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue=\n to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government=\n affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout=\nh America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts=\n, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.\n\nI am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs =\nto provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Comm=\nittee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman,=\n Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord=\n, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also con=\ntinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry King=\nerski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am form=\ning a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of =\nJose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself=\n.\n\nNo organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf=\nect or permanent.

We are all saddened by=\n the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr=\noup fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each othe=\nr and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, f=\nor those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excelle=\nnce and integrity that has characterized our group.

To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is =\nnot easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor=\nk, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we =\nshared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=\n have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=\n are leaving for all you have done.\n\nAs to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =\nme that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=\nctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =\nability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee=\nd to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all =\nU.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, =\nJim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j=\nointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of =\nthe group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h=\nelp Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=\ndership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=\nty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =\nbe led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La=\nst, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o=\nn California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part=\n of the Wholesale electricity team).\n\nSteve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =\ndevelopment effort along with Dan Allegretti.\n\nWith the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=\n a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=\nislative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=\nill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=\n will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=\nelopment efforts across the U.S.\n\nMuch of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti=\nnue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, =\ntaking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi=\nm will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con=\ntinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over su=\npport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market=\ns, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue=\n to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government=\n affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout=\nh America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts=\n, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.\n\nI am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs =\nto provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Comm=\nittee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman,=\n Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord=\n, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also con=\ntinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry King=\nerski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am form=\ning a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of =\nJose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself=\n.\n\nNo organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf=\nect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more pre=\npared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as th=\ne future unfolds for the company.\n\nOne final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through =\nthis uncertain and troubled period for the company.  We are all saddened by=\n the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr=\noup fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each othe=\nr and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, f=\nor those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excelle=\nnce and integrity that has characterized our group.  Personally, I will do =\nall I can, for as long as I can, to steer the group through this to the ver=\ny best place possible.  Your continued dedication and support is very much =\nappreciated.  Hang in there and thanks.\n\n"", "" \n\n \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tShapiro, Richard  \nSent:\tMonday, November 19, 2001 7:18 PM\nTo:\tSteffes, James D.\nSubject:\tRE: Govt Affairs Org Chart\nImportance:\tHigh\n\n\nCan you  forward  both org. charts to me together?\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tSteffes, James D.  \nSent:\tMonday, November 19, 2001 6:12 PM\nTo:\tDietrich, Janet\nCc:\tShapiro, Richard\nSubject:\tGovt Affairs Org Chart\n\nJanet --\n\nHere is the org chart that captures our discussions.

In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? \""What we do in life echoes through eternity\"".  I think of these words often and believe them more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and internal to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whether in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made in the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere.  \n\nRegardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what we have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal appreciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportunity to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where these changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to earn your trust and respect.  \n\nOn a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advance of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.

APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  \n\nAs to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (\""RECs\""), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. \n\nTrading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.

APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  \n\nAs to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (\""RECs\""), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. \n\nTrading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.  Doug Gilbert-Smith this afternoon identified the following counterparties in decreasing order of of their priority as trading partners in ERCOT:  \n\nTXU Energy Trading \nBP Energy Company\nReliant Energy Services, Inc.\nAquila Power Corporation\nMorgan Stanley capitral Group\nConstellation Power Source\nFPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc.\nAmerican Electic Power Service Corporation\nMirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP\nCalpine Energy Servicces LP\nDynegy Marketing & Trade\nLCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority\n\nalong with a couple of incumbent utilities:\n\nSan Antonio City Public Service\nReliant HL&P\n\nIf you desire Doug Gilbert -Smith to sit in on this meeting, then it would have to be scheduled for Thursday.\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tSteffes, James D.  \nSent:\tWednesday, January 30, 2002 8:41 AM\nTo:\tGilbert-smith, Doug; Day, Smith L.; Sager, Elizabeth; Portz, David\nCc:\tWill, Lloyd; Presto, Kevin M.; Bailey, Debra; Haedicke, Mark E.\nSubject:\tUBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs\n\nUBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.

(ENE) will require Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval, FERC Chairman Pat Wood III confirmed Wednesday. \nOnce cleared by the bankruptcy court, FERC expects to receive an application for approval of the deal under the commission's authority, Wood told reporters. \nFERC's jurisdiction involves the transfer of Enron's commission-granted authority to regulate the rates at which Enron sells electricity and natural gas, said Cynthia Marlette, FERC's general counsel. \nBut Marlette indicated the commission is mulling whether to exert a broader regulatory reach over the deal. \""The commission hasn't opined yet whether it has jurisdiction over the corporate transfer,\"" she said. \nAs announced in recent days, UBS Warburg, a unit of UBS AG (U.UBS), will assume Enron's trading business with little if any cash up front, while paying Enron royalties equal to 33% of pre-tax earnings. \nThe bankruptcy judge is due to rule on the deal later this week.

APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  \n\nAs to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (\""RECs\""), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. \n\nTrading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.

Before I turn to the organizational=\n changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t=\nhe company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are b=\ny their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of t=\nhis group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had =\nthat responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re=\nsponsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven=\n by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat=\ned group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also =\nvery decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is =\nnot easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor=\nk, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we =\nshared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=\n have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=\n are leaving for all you have done.\n\nAs to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =\nme that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=\nctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =\nability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee=\nd to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all =\nU.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, =\nJim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j=\nointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of =\nthe group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h=\nelp Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=\ndership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=\nty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =\nbe led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La=\nst, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o=\nn California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part=\n of the Wholesale electricity team).\n\nSteve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =\ndevelopment effort along with Dan Allegretti.\n\nWith the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=\n a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=\nislative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=\nill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=\n will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=\nelopment efforts across the U.S.\n\nMuch of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti=\nnue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, =\ntaking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi=\nm will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con=\ntinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over su=\npport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market=\ns, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue=\n to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government=\n affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout=\nh America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts=\n, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.\n\nI am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs =\nto provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Comm=\nittee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman,=\n Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord=\n, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also con=\ntinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry King=\nerski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am form=\ning a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of =\nJose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself=\n.\n\nNo organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf=\nect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more pre=\npared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as th=\ne future unfolds for the company.\n\nOne final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through =\nthis uncertain and troubled period for the company.  We are all saddened by=\n the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr=\noup fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each othe=\nr and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, f=\nor those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excelle=\nnce and integrity that has characterized our group.  Personally, I will do =\nall I can, for as long as I can, to steer the group through this to the ver=\ny best place possible.  Your continued dedication and support is very much =\nappreciated.

I have =\nbeen searching for a way to capture what we've done here and was reading a =\nbook the other day about Teddy Roosevelt, former President of the United St=\nates, and saw a quote that I thought was appropriate to our group and circu=\nmstances?the quote is,=20\n\n\""the credit belongs to the person who is actually in the arena?who strives =\nvaliantly, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends =\nhimself in worthy causes.  Who, at best, knows the triumph of high achievem=\nent and who, at worst, if he fails, fails while daring greatly so that his =\nplace shall never be with those cold and timid souls, who knew neither vict=\nory nor defeat.\""\n\nThe work that we did here was great.  The way we did it, I believe, sets an=\n example for those who will attempt to fill our shoes?and we fought for the=\n right cause, i.e., competitive markets around the world.  Our victories we=\nre many and often directly due to our presence and leadership?the failure t=\nhat we are experiencing as a company, however, that is so deep and so thoro=\nugh, was not of our making.  I don't know exactly what the days and weeks a=\nhead hold for any of us, but I am quite confident that the good work that w=\ne do and the way that we do it, and the sense of community that we were abl=\ne to create in this group, will show up in new places and new companies all=\n around the world over the next months and years.  I hope to speak to many,=\n if not all of you, on a one to one basis over the next several weeks to ex=\npress my thanks and gratitude for having had the opportunity to work with y=\nou, but I also want to take this opportunity to wish each of you the best i=\nn the future and during this holiday season.\n\nThank you\n"", ""I can be on.

I do not know for sure what the next few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whether in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made in the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere.  \n\nRegardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what we have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.

We expect Congress to be in session until late November or even into December. \n\nThe PTC extension was passed out of the House in its energy package (it was part of the tax title).  The Senate Committee is expected to consider its version of the energy in September into October.  We expect the PTC to pass in the Senate as well.\n\nNow to the timing, it is unclear if the energy package (with the PTC extension)will move before Congress adjourns for the year.  If it does not, then Congress can pass what it calls an \""extenders package\"" which would extend all tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year.  If that were to not happen, then Congress could send notice to the Administration that it plans to pass the PTC and other extenders early next year and make it retroactive until December 31, 2001.  Any of theses scenarios is possible.\n\nWhile nothing is 100% when you deal with Congress, I think it highly likely the PTC will be extended either this year or retroactively next.  The question then becomes for how long.  The House bill extends it for five years and we are pushing for longer in the Senate.  I do not think a permanent extension is possible given the revenue numbers.\n\nLet me know if you need additional information.\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Walia, Amit \nSent: Wednesday, August 22, 2001 10:51 AM\nTo: Long, Chris\nCc: Metts, Mark\nSubject: Wind Production Tax Credit (PTC)\n\n\nChris,\n\nWe wanted to get an update on what was happending with the PTC in Washington.

The PTC will be extended.   There is significant bipartisan support for the PTC, the revenue number is reasonable, and renewables are a key component of the energy debate.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe question is when and how.  Two likely scenarios are:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1)  As part of the Energy Bill.  The House Ways and Means Committee will mark-up the tax portions of the energy bill in mid-July.  We understand that Chairman Thomas is committed to including the PTC as part of the Ways and Means bill.  The Senate Finance Committee has not scheduled a mark-up.  While the energy bill will be debated during July, final action will likely not occur until after the August recess.   In this scenario, look to September at the earliest.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2)  There are 10 provisions, including the PTC,  in the IRC that expire by December 31, 2001.   Historically, Congress approves an \""extenders\"" package late in the session to keep the tax credits functioning.   While no one can predict when Congress will adjourn, they are set to adjourn in early October.  In this scenario, the PTC would be extended in late September at the earliest.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMark, this is Congress, so anything can change.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCall me with any questions at (202) 466-9158.\n"", ""\n\nA few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs group commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to California.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? \""What we do in life echoes through eternity\"".  I think of these words often and believe them more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and internal to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whether in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made in the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere.  \n\nRegardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what we have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal appreciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportunity to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.

There are a few, however, that may be incorrectly categorized, as follows:\n \nEA:             ECT Non U.S. Payroll Company (there is no such entity, but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA)\n                   Enron Capital & Trade Resources in London, UK  (may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited)\n \nEBS:           Broadband Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (actually comes up to Corp. through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance)\n \nEEOS:        Enron Engineering & Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp.\n                   The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd. whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe.  \n \nEES:           Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity\n                    The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities Services/Limbach companies\n \nEGA:         Here's where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with \n                 complicated, multi-layers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp. ownership.  As you know all of the old subsets (i.e. APACHI, CALME, etc.) have\n                 gone away and everything international is now EGA.    To the best of our knowledge, all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed.\n                 Following are the exceptions and/or unusual organizational structure that should be noted:\n                    Electricidad Enron de Guatemala S.A. actually reports up through ENA\n                    San Juan Gas Company, Inc. in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp. (100% owned)\n                    Enron American del Sur, S.A.  is an Enron Corp./Enron Transportation Services entity\n                    No entity called Enron Singapore .... more than likely Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company.\n \nEIM:         No Stadacona Paper Company but it  is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM \n                Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp. as the general partner and a list of Limited\n                Partners including ENA, Enron Corp. and a non-Enron entity (Salomon Brothers Holding Company, Inc.)\n \nENW:        Enron Net Works, LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp. company\n \nEWC:        The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp. which is owned by Smith Street Land Co., an Enron Corp. company, but many of the \n                 names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list.   For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas, S.A.; \n                 no Enron Wind UK, no Enron Wind India .... but regardless, they are all part of the EWC/EREC family.\n \nGLOBAL    These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration & Production, Inc., which is owned by Enron Corp., but one has indirect outside ownership.\n EP:           Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd., for instance, is owned by Enron Asst Holdings, which is owned by Enron Finance Partners, which is part of a complex ownership\n                 structure that includes one non-Enron entity (Zephyrus Investments, LLC) with a small interest.      \n                    \nAgain, I hope this information is helpful.

Call with questions.\n \n "", ""\nWith the announcement of Enron's acquisition by Dynegy behind us, and with =\nthe initial severance process completed, it seemed an appropriate time to e=\nffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared=\n to meet the challenges of the future.  Before I turn to the organizational=\n changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t=\nhe company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are b=\ny their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of t=\nhis group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had =\nthat responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re=\nsponsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven=\n by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat=\ned group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also =\nvery decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is =\nnot easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor=\nk, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we =\nshared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=\n have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=\n are leaving for all you have done.\n\nAs to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =\nme that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=\nctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =\nability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee=\nd to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all =\nU.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, =\nJim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j=\nointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of =\nthe group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h=\nelp Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=\ndership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=\nty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =\nbe led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La=\nst, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o=\nn California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part=\n of the Wholesale electricity team).\n\nSteve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =\ndevelopment effort along with Dan Allegretti.\n\nWith the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=\n a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=\nislative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=\nill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=\n will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=\nelopment efforts across the U.S.\n\nMuch of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti=\nnue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, =\ntaking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi=\nm will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con=\ntinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over su=\npport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market=\ns, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue=\n to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government=\n affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout=\nh America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts=\n, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.\n\nI am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs =\nto provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Comm=\nittee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman,=\n Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord=\n, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also con=\ntinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry King=\nerski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am form=\ning a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of =\nJose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself=\n.\n\nNo organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf=\nect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more pre=\npared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as th=\ne future unfolds for the company.\n\nOne final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through =\nthis uncertain and troubled period for the company.  We are all saddened by=\n the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr=\noup fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each othe=\nr and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, f=\nor those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excelle=\nnce and integrity that has characterized our group.  Personally, I will do =\nall I can, for as long as I can, to steer the group through this to the ver=\ny best place possible.  Your continued dedication and support is very much =\nappreciated.

I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.  She consistently does not take messages properly.  Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.\n\nThe kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.\n\nWe continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.\n\n\nIn summary, Heidi's performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.

I also appreciate the tremendous amount of stress that you have been under especially considering the birth of your second child.  I do not envy you now, yet I am sincerely grateful that it is you and Greg leading us through these times.\n\nThe message that you have sent throughout my six years with Enron has been \""trust the system until it fails you\"".  We would all be disappointed if our troubled times were a result of a few (rather large) ill-conceived investments, but the violation of trust comes from the deliberate misrepresentation of facts.  Namely the restatement of earnings and balance sheet items back to 1997.  We have all based our decisions to continue employment with Enron upon publicly available information.  Has fraudulence been proven in a court of law?  No.  However, the court of public opinion has already had it its trial, the perpetrators have been convicted and the victims now await retribution.  In this matter, the corporation is responsible to the court of public opinions jurisdiction.  I write you now to offer my version of justice.\n\nFrom 1997 to date I have received restricted stock and options with a notional value of approximately $700,000 (by memory).  At the end of each compensation period, I based my decision to continue my employment with Enron on all publicly available information.  This corporation has deliberately and knowingly misrepresented these facts.  Today, I call on Enron to repurchase my entire equity portfolio and replace it with a one time lump sum payment equal to the exact notional value.\n\nMy situation is certainly unique.  I can save you the effort and inform you that my net career to date contribution is $zero.  To this I have three responses: (1)  At no time did I falter from the highest ethical standard, whereas Enron has; (2) I am calling for Enron to address its misrepresentations made prior to my 2001 misfortune.  It would be an injustice for Enron to use my 2001 performance to justify its prior unethical compensation program; and (3) I am fully prepared to accept zero performance bonus for this year. \n\nEnron may not be able to offer this solution to all of its employees.  You may need to make decisions on who to keep.  Perhaps Enron should offer to release those less desired individuals from any contractual obligations.\n\nJohn, I recognize that these issues cannot be resolved over night.  I will be as patient as I can be.\n\nSincerely,\nKeith"", ""Per an email from Mike Grigsby, I understand we are splitting the west into two regions.

But if that was to fall through, Canada would attempt to find its own white knight, so to speak. We had numerous expressions of interest and none of those have been pursued at this time.\""\nHouston-based Enron Corp. was negotiating yesterday with at least six potential buyers for its wholesale trading business in an auction that was part of efforts to reorganize itself under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The auction was expected to continue into the evening.\nIn Manhattan, U.S. bankruptcy judge Arthur J. Gonzalez scheduled a hearing for today to approve the sale.\nEnron Canada was Canada's largest market maker of natural gas and power until it was swept up in the failure of its indirect parent, which unraveled after disclosures that Enron Corp. had shifted billions of dollars in debt off its books. It was left saddled with at least US$40-billion in debt.\nEnron Corp.'s troubles deepened this week with revelations that the U.S. Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation. There was also an admission yesterday by the firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, that a \""significant but undetermined\"" number of documents related to the company had been destroyed.\nMr. Milnthorp said the investigation \""has nothing to do with Enron Canada.\""\nThe Canadian unit attempted last month to distance itself from the parent and re-emerge as an independent company but gave up after losing a bid in an Alberta court to keep counterparties from unwinding contracts, its major asset.\nMr. Milnthorp said the Canadian arm was packaged as part of a deal to sell Enron's overall trading business, which buys and sells oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, metals, coal, forest products and steel, and a variety of contracts and derivatives. The company would get cash and a 49% stake in a new partnership called \""Netco,\"" short for New Energy Trading Company, under the proposed sale. The trading unit generated about 90% of Enron Corp.'s US$100.8- billion in revenue in 2000.\nMr. Milnthorp said 75 employees in Calgary and Toronto were laid off after last month's court proceedings and trading was suspended because of lack of confidence in the market.\n\""To be successful in this business, you need a very solid balance sheet that creates the confidence necessary to enter into long-term transactions. That's been one of the key criteria through the auction process,\"" he said.\nEnron Canada's remaining employees are \""trying to manage the estate and trying to work hard to co-operate with our customers to get them paid,\"" he said.\nThe unit is cash rich from the sale last month of its interest in the Sundance B power-generating plant outside of Edmonton.\nBidders for all or parts of the trading operation include Citigroup Inc., the largest financial services company, UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, and BP PLC, one of the largest oil and gas companies.\nccattaneo@nationalpost.com <mailto:ccattaneo@nationalpost.com>"", "" \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Enron Canada General Announcements \nSent: Friday, November 30, 2001 7:51 AM\nTo: DL-GA-Canada_Calgary\nSubject: Front Doors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnron Canada will be locking the front doors today (Friday, November 30, 2001).  \n\nVisitors will be allowed in by appointment only.

Uncomfortable with UBS's committment to the business\n\t\t2. Surprised that no one from UBS has spoken directly with him\n\t\t3. Seems like he wants to build/run a team and is motivated by money.\n\t\t4. His interperetation of the contract is that even if this deal fails, his would be bound by a none compete until the end.\n\n\tSolution:  Money alone is not enough because does not address 1 and 2.  He needs someone (senior) from UBS to spend some time with him to:\n\t\t   (a) help him fell more comfortable with UBS's committment; (b) get him excited by the possiblity to lead/shape/direct the weather group\n\t\t   (this notion seemed to catch his interest during our discussion with him); (c) and present him with a new deal (no more of this aim for 80%\n\t\t   happy bullshit).  This new deal will need considerably less restrictive language--talk with Hunter about specifics.\n\nAdam:\tIssue:  1. Has interest in returing to the air force (his window to do so is until July 7th.)\n\n\tSolution:  Appears that money is not his first priority.  Any offer of money that precludes him from the July 7th window will be unsuccessful!\n\t\t   Our strategy needs to be one that gives him some respectable money that he can keep as long as he stays until June 1st (after he is\n\t\t   committed it may be possible to persuade him to stay longer).  He will not accept an offer that takes away his air force option!!!!!!  Also,\n\t\t   I think signing him will be alot easier once others have committed.\n\nJose:\tIssue:\t1. Recongnizes that senior management (You, Greg, and Louise) have done a good job closing the deal, but have failed to address HR\n\t\t    issues.  He thinks that this failure has existed much longer than just during the bankrupcy.  (Quoted, \""Mike had to fight way to hard\n\t\t    to get the very basic things for his team since day 1.\"")\n\n\tSolution:  The most difficult of the three to sell.

I also appreciate the tremendous amount of stress that you have been under especially considering the birth of your second child.  I do not envy you now, yet I am sincerely grateful that it is you and Greg leading us through these times.\n\nThe message that you have sent throughout my six years with Enron has been \""trust the system until it fails you\"".  We would all be disappointed if our troubled times were a result of a few (rather large) ill-conceived investments, but the violation of trust comes from the deliberate misrepresentation of facts.  Namely the restatement of earnings and balance sheet items back to 1997.  We have all based our decisions to continue employment with Enron upon publicly available information.  Has fraudulence been proven in a court of law?  No.  However, the court of public opinion has already had it its trial, the perpetrators have been convicted and the victims now await retribution.  In this matter, the corporation is responsible to the court of public opinions jurisdiction.  I write you now to offer my version of justice.\n\nFrom 1997 to date I have received restricted stock and options with a notional value of approximately $700,000 (by memory).  At the end of each compensation period, I based my decision to continue my employment with Enron on all publicly available information.  This corporation has deliberately and knowingly misrepresented these facts.  Today, I call on Enron to repurchase my entire equity portfolio and replace it with a one time lump sum payment equal to the exact notional value.\n\nMy situation is certainly unique.  I can save you the effort and inform you that my net career to date contribution is $zero.  To this I have three responses: (1)  At no time did I falter from the highest ethical standard, whereas Enron has; (2) I am calling for Enron to address its misrepresentations made prior to my 2001 misfortune.  It would be an injustice for Enron to use my 2001 performance to justify its prior unethical compensation program; and (3) I am fully prepared to accept zero performance bonus for this year. \n\nEnron may not be able to offer this solution to all of its employees.  You may need to make decisions on who to keep.  Perhaps Enron should offer to release those less desired individuals from any contractual obligations.\n\nJohn, I recognize that these issues cannot be resolved over night.  I will be as patient as I can be.\n\nSincerely,\nKeith"", ""What is the name of the file in O: drop box so I can make sure these trades are reducing risk?\n\nThanx for all your help\n\nChris"", ""Get on MSN Messenger"", ""\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tFitzpatrick, Amy  \nSent:\tTuesday, January 22, 2002 4:33 PM\nTo:\tPresto, Kevin M.; Sturm, Fletcher J.; Furrow, Dale; Robinson, Mitch; Will, Lloyd; Bentley, Corry; Gilbert-smith, Doug; Davis, Mark Dana; Curry, Mike; Arora, Harry; Baughman Jr., Don; Lagrasta, Fred; Shively, Hunter S.; Grigsby, Mike; Neal, Scott; Martin, Thomas A.\nCc:\tCalger, Christopher F.; Slone, Jeanie; Oxley, David; Curless, Amanda; Davies, Neil\nSubject:\tFW: UBS meeting tommorrow @ 10 am till 1pm\n\nPlease advise your team members who:\n\n1.

I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now.---sch\nIs Enron the New Drexel? \nBy Michael Lewis, the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.''\nBerkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. \nThe boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers. The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press. Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company! And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie. \nUnderstandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one. \nOther than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Michael Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it. But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay. \nAlumni Will Flourish \nTrue, in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them. And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and Enron's energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust. \nJust as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business, former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell, the energy trading business will return to normal. \nBut the morality of the cases are entirely different. Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves. \nThere was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones. He paid himself huge sums of money, but he also made huge sums for his firm. He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him, and they loved him for it. The Enron bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag. \nDifferent Motivations \nEnron created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was. Milken created an operation which was, if anything, much more profitable than it looked. What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits. What Enron hid was the sneaky way it made its losses. \n(This is something I still don't understand, and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain, as Enron seems intent on explaining nothing. The off-the-books partnerships that brought Enron down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets -- Turkish gas pipelines, Indian power plants and the like. Why did Enron, which made its money as an intermediary, invest in this stuff in the first place?) \nThe speed with which the markets have punished Enron reflects the differences between it and Drexel. In Drexel's case, it took a multiyear investigation by the U.S. government, together with a smear campaign in the press, to bring down the business. In Enron's case, all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out, among other things, that senior executives were profiting at the company's expense. \nIn Drexel's case, the demise of the firm and the jailing of Milken was pretty much the end of the story. In Enron's, the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top. Anything is possible. \n \nBerkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. \nThe boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers.

I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now.---sch\nIs Enron the New Drexel? \nBy Michael Lewis, the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.''\nBerkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. \nThe boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers. The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press. Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company! And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie. \nUnderstandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one. \nOther than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Michael Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it. But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay. \nAlumni Will Flourish \nTrue, in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them. And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and Enron's energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust. \nJust as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business, former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell, the energy trading business will return to normal. \nBut the morality of the cases are entirely different. Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves. \nThere was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones. He paid himself huge sums of money, but he also made huge sums for his firm. He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him, and they loved him for it. The Enron bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag. \nDifferent Motivations \nEnron created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was. Milken created an operation which was, if anything, much more profitable than it looked. What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits. What Enron hid was the sneaky way it made its losses. \n(This is something I still don't understand, and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain, as Enron seems intent on explaining nothing. The off-the-books partnerships that brought Enron down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets -- Turkish gas pipelines, Indian power plants and the like. Why did Enron, which made its money as an intermediary, invest in this stuff in the first place?) \nThe speed with which the markets have punished Enron reflects the differences between it and Drexel. In Drexel's case, it took a multiyear investigation by the U.S. government, together with a smear campaign in the press, to bring down the business. In Enron's case, all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out, among other things, that senior executives were profiting at the company's expense. \nIn Drexel's case, the demise of the firm and the jailing of Milken was pretty much the end of the story. In Enron's, the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top. Anything is possible. \n \nBerkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. \nThe boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers.

As you guys know the 2002 shippers lists of 211,000 / day is made up 2 shippers Calpine 35,000/day and Newport Gen 175,000/day and this expansion has it's own issues.  \n\nAs we know more about shippers moving around I will pass on... pls do same.\n\nBT "", ""I have informed Zach McCarroll that he will not be offered a position with UBS.

I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.\n\nIf you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.\n\nHappy New Year\n\nLouise"", ""Keith Holst and Frank Ermis\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tKeiser, Kam  \nSent:\tWednesday, January 09, 2002 12:00 PM\nTo:\tGrigsby, Mike\nSubject:\tbroker quotes\n\nMike,\n\nDo you or anyone else in your group get broker quotes on a daily basis to help set the curves?

In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  \n\nJeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.\n\nI know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.\n\nPlease join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."", ""\n\nMarty Klepper just called and wanted to know where he can send something to you tomorrow.

There are a few, however, that may be incorrectly categorized, as follows:\n \nEA:             ECT Non U.S. Payroll Company (there is no such entity, but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA)\n                   Enron Capital & Trade Resources in London, UK  (may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited)\n \nEBS:           Broadband Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (actually comes up to Corp. through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance)\n \nEEOS:        Enron Engineering & Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp.\n                   The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd. whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe.  \n \nEES:           Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity\n                    The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities Services/Limbach companies\n \nEGA:         Here's where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with \n                 complicated, multi-layers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp. ownership.  As you know all of the old subsets (i.e. APACHI, CALME, etc.) have\n                 gone away and everything international is now EGA.    To the best of our knowledge, all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed.\n                 Following are the exceptions and/or unusual organizational structure that should be noted:\n                    Electricidad Enron de Guatemala S.A. actually reports up through ENA\n                    San Juan Gas Company, Inc. in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp. (100% owned)\n                    Enron American del Sur, S.A.  is an Enron Corp./Enron Transportation Services entity\n                    No entity called Enron Singapore .... more than likely Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company.\n \nEIM:         No Stadacona Paper Company but it  is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM \n                Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp. as the general partner and a list of Limited\n                Partners including ENA, Enron Corp. and a non-Enron entity (Salomon Brothers Holding Company, Inc.)\n \nENW:        Enron Net Works, LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp. company\n \nEWC:        The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp. which is owned by Smith Street Land Co., an Enron Corp. company, but many of the \n                 names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list.   For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas, S.A.; \n                 no Enron Wind UK, no Enron Wind India .... but regardless, they are all part of the EWC/EREC family.\n \nGLOBAL    These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration & Production, Inc., which is owned by Enron Corp., but one has indirect outside ownership.\n EP:           Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd., for instance, is owned by Enron Asst Holdings, which is owned by Enron Finance Partners, which is part of a complex ownership\n                 structure that includes one non-Enron entity (Zephyrus Investments, LLC) with a small interest.      \n                    \nAgain, I hope this information is helpful.  For the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track.

GMS views a late chart as a chart that is not in their possession by COB on the 3rd working day of the month.   In further discussions with the GSM employees and Gary Anderson it was confirmed that they do not have any idea how many charts were late for the December close.  They also cannot produce a report reflecting when charts were received.\n\nThe PGAS program can has a chart tracking feature that requires each chart to have a bar code label and that GMS read the bar code when charts are received. Use of this process for all charts and index cards would provide a report of those charts that are late.  Two reports could be generated, one at COB on the third business day of each month and again as a part of the final close.  This process would tell us monthly where we have issues but to date it apparently has not been used. \n\nI have requested that Gary Anderson, for January business, provide through the PGAS report or other means a report by customer of the late charts.  These would be the charts that should be in the hands of GMS by the close of business on February 5.  This report should provide us with an idea of where we stand in respect to the late chart issue.  We will also request that GMS to mandate the use of the PGAS report to track receipt of charts going forward even after we have initiated the new mailing process.  We will monitor this activity on a monthly basis until we get comfortable with the process.\n\nCharlie has indicated that the overnight mail process should be in progress by the first of March.  Charlie will follow up on the other issues discussed.\n\nIf you have questions, please advise.\n\nDon\n\n\n"", ""Calm down.  The operative word is it has been put on hold.

Prior to the move, we had a very efficient, open configuration that let us work together as a unified team.  \n\nAfter the move, we are located on 3 different floors.   Besides the general impact on team unity, this move also means that our evening staff work alone on separate floors, rather than in a group.  It means fewer individuals to cover customer calls.  It means having more equipment to cover the day to day business.   I have worked hard to calm the team that this arrangement is just temporary and that we will eventually be put back together as a team.\n\nPrior to our move I constantly questioned whether our move was necessary.  I asked about smaller, more practical changes to fit more people on the floor.  And, I specifically asked about whether Enron issues might impact the groups desire to continue to spend $7-$10 million -- even as I reluctantly packed up my boxes.\n\nI hope you can appreciate that the current seating arrangement is a serious issue for my team and one that generates constant questions as my staff meetings.

Specifically, you organized your presentation in a logical sequence, you spoke distinctly with varying voice inflection and without \""umms\"" (a very difficult thing to do!), and you related well to your audience through a friendly tone in your voice and in your body language (smiles, eye contact and open posture).  Watching and listening, I both \""liked\"" you and felt \""sold\"" on the seriousness of you and your group in executing the duties of your function and providing effective customer service.\n\nTo improve the effectiveness of your slide show, you might consider reducing the number of bullets in some slides.  As a general rule, slides become \""busy\"" and impact the receiver's comprehension when the number of bullets gets past about six; so, I suggest that you limit the number of bullets in any one slide to 5 or 6 and break up a list any longer than that into two or more slides.  This will make your audience more comfortable and enhance their retention.\n\nThanks for the effort and energy you put into your session.  I learned helpful new things about gas logistics and enjoyed your presentation.  You were very effective.\n\nRegards,\n- Roger\n\nCopy:  Stan Horton\n(Note to Stan - I had to step out while you were speaking; so, please don't expect this level of feedback on your presentation, though I'm sure it went just as well!)"", ""\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tSchaffer, Brian  \nSent:\tTuesday, November 20, 2001 11:39 AM\nTo:\tMcCarty, Danny; Hayslett, Rod; Corman, Shelley; Hotte, Steve; Fossum, Drew; Hartsoe, Joe; Cordes, Bill\nCc:\tBatista, Daniel; Fagan, Fran; Hasenjager, Norma; Goetzinger, Marilyn\nSubject:\tPersonal Achievement Awards\n\nAll:\n\n\tPlease let me know if you have any questions regarding the utilization of the PAA Program at this point.  \n\n\tAs noted, the remaining balance is now \""pooled\"", but any requests should be submitted as soon as possible, and no later than 30 November.\n\nBrian\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tHutcherson, Leesa  \nSent:\tTuesday, November 20, 2001 10:21 AM\nTo:\tBatista, Daniel; Carlson, Jim; Crum, Dea; Dodd, Wilford; Dorris, Marsha; Fagan, Fran; Fox, Sherry; Goetzinger, Marilyn; Hamilton, Ivan; Harkreader, Jerry ; Hasenjager, Norma; Pena, Renee; Schaffer, Brian; Scott, Tracy; Southard, Miranda; Vaughn, Ann\nCc:\tDomke, Jana; Denby, Michele; Smith, Gary; Perry, Carolyn\nSubject:\tPAA\n\nAs discussed in our staff meeting yesterday, the 2001 PAA Program will end effective December 3, 2001.

She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -\n\n1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the \""Dynegy transition\"" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven. [Geaccone, Tracy]  The lower capital is probably from the revised plan.  I am okey with the other assumption. \n2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers? [Geaccone, Tracy]  Costs have been reduced due to Dynegy transition.  If we assume under our control, costs would be the same or slightly lower.  I would propose the same for now. \n3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the \""contract roll off\"" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative. [Geaccone, Tracy]    I think this is a good assumption \n4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more \""reasonable\"" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. \n5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.\n\nAny thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.

Install Tears 6.2 and enter the\ncommand <C:\\ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>.\n\nHusband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and\nFlowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to\nGrumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad\nprogram that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files.\n\nDO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend\nprogram. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.\n\nIn summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a\nlimited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly.

I\nhave a full life.\""\n\n   The American interrupted, \""I have an MBA from Harvard and I can help\nyou!\n\n   \""You should start by fishing longer every day. You can then sell the\nextra fish you catch. With the extra revenue, you can buy a bigger\nboat. With the extra money the larger boat will bring, you can buy a\nsecond one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of\ntrawlers.\n\n   \""Instead of selling your fish to a middleman, you can negotiate\ndirectly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant.\nYou can then leave this little village and move to Mexico City, Los\nAngeles, or even New York City! From there you can direct your huge\nenterprise.\""\n\n   \""How long would that take?\"" asked the Mexican.\n\n   \""Twenty, perhaps twenty-five years,\"" replied the American.\n\n   \""And after that?\""\n\n   \""Afterwards? That's when it gets really interesting,\"" answered the\nAmerican, laughing. \""When your business gets really big, you can start\nselling stocks and make millions!\""\n\n   \""Millions? Really? And after that?\""\n\n   \""After that you'll be able to retire, live in a tiny village near\nthe coast, sleep late, play with your children, catch a few fish, take\na siesta, and spend your evenings drinking and enjoying your friends!\""\n\n   Ordinary Life auditor Wayne Herbert sent me that and it is just a\nwonderful story about the kinds of things I want us to be about.\n\n   I sometimes refer to what wants to happen in here with the phrase\n\""Journey Into Wholeness.\"" It is so easy for those of us in the West to\nthink that that journey is out there somewhere, in the outer world. The\ngoal of spiritual work is to become a \""self.\"" Or, to become aware of\nthe Self. I can't adequately explain to you what this self is. It is\nthe center and, at the same time, the circumference of the personality.\nIt embraces both consciousness and unconsciousness. The Self is known\nas the Christ in Christianity.\n\n   Journey into Wholeness. The root meaning of the word \""holiness\"" is\nthis wholeness. Wholeness involves finding the missing parts or the\nfaculties that are lacking in our natures and restoring them to a\ndignified place in our personality. Usually for those of us in the\nWestern world our need, as reflected in the story of the Mexican\nfisherman, is relatedness; relatedness to ourselves as well as to\nothers. This is the principle of equality I've spoken to you about so\noften. We who speak English are limited to one word for \""love.\"" In\nSanskrit there are ninety-six words for love. We are highly specialized\nin technology yet quite primitive in terms of feelings.\n\n   Jesus, and other Eastern spiritual teachers, saw the outer world to\nbe of little importance. The place where the kingdom of God was was\ninside and among us. For us, however, reality is in the outer,\nmaterial, physical world. One of the ways this has affected Christian\ntheology is the emphasis on a belief that we are so unique, so\ndistinctive that even our bodies persist on the other side of death.\nThe religion out of which we came, Judaism, thought that after death\nwhat happened to us was much like what happens to a dewdrop after the\nsunrise. Yes, it has individuality while it exists as a separate\nentity, but it is destined quite quickly to flow back into the great\nprimal ocean of existence and to lose all individuality. Does a drop of\nwater cease to exist when it falls back into the sea? Well, yes and no.\nNothing is lost but its individuality is no more. Jesus knew that the\nego was a great troublemaker for us.\n\n   We cling to everything that we think defines us as individuals. To\nthreaten this notion of who we are is hell. We protect what we call our\nindividuality at all costs. Death is bearable only if we are guaranteed\na life after death containing all the characteristics of our individual\nhuman life.\n\n   You can see how this would affect the way we go about living our\nlives and making choices about who we are and what are we to do. Those\nwere the questions that shaped, by the way, what became our Bible.\nAfter every great cultural upheaval the community of people raised the\nquestions: Who are we and what are we to do?\n\n   e.e. cummings once wrote, \""To be yourself in a world that is doing\nits best to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle\nany human being can fight, and never stop fighting.\""\n\n   I love the story of the Pentecostal man who wandered into, let us\nsay, a Methodist church. During the sermon, the visitor got so excited\nthat whenever the preacher made a point, the Pentecostal man would\nscream out, \""Praise God!\"" or \""Hallelujah!\"" or \""Amen!\"" The ushers were\nso distraught about the Pentecostal's behavior that the head usher went\ndown the aisle and whispered to him: \""You'll have to keep quiet? The\npastor's right in the middle of the sermon!\"" The Pentecostal man said,\n\""Keep quiet? How can I keep quiet? I've got the Holy Spirit!\"" To which\nthe usher said, \""Well, you didn't get it in this church!\""\n\n   The Pentecostal man made a theological error that many of us make.\nYou see, he didn't have the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit had him! And\nthat's the problem with much of our theology. We wish he had the Holy\nSpirit. There's a part of us that wishes we could keep the Holy Spirit\nin the nice, neat, tidy confines of our categories and barriers. We'd\nlike to put God in a box.\n\n   Get this: Nobody has the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit always has us\nand, given our Western orientation, that scares us so that we resist\nand repress and deny until we are spiritual dead as doornails. We want\na God in a box like we want everything else in our lives predictable\nand controllable. We want a religion that is safe. A journey that is\npredictable. There is no true spiritual journey that is that way.\n\n   We modern people have been victimized by own modernity. Of course,\nwe've benefited - we have the sciences, technology, modern medicine,\neven emphases on human rights come from our modern approach to things.\nBut it has had two deeply destructive effects on our religious and\nspiritual life.\n\n   For one thing it has made people skeptical about spiritual reality.\nIf God can't be proved by modern means, then God must not be.\n\n   Second, modernity has led us to be preoccupied with factuality -\nwith scientifically verifiable and historically reliable facts. Modern\nWestern culture is the only culture in human history that has\nidentified truth with factuality. We are, as Marcus Borg calls us,\n\""fact fundamentalists.\"" If a statement isn't scientifically or\nhistorically factual, it isn't true. These two things are serious\nmistakes and deadly to the journey inward.\n\n   Let me point out that both liberals and conservatives can be fact\nfundamentalists. Liberals try to rescue a few facts from the fire.\nConservatives say the Bible must be factually true in order to be true\nat all. This is why they emphasize the literal and historical\nfactuality of biblical texts. They both agree - facts are what matters.\n\n   If I had a magic wand that worked, one of the things I would do is\nto get both liberals and conservatives alike to see how modern both of\nthese positions are.\n\n   What we've got when it comes to having faith today for most people\nis whether they can believe \""iffy\"" things or not. That, to most people,\nis what Christianity has become. It is as if what God wants most from\nus is believing highly problematic statements to be factually true.\nAnd, if you can't believe them, then you don't \""have faith\"" and\nprobably aren't a Christian.\n\n   Listen carefully: Faith has to do with your relation to God, to\nSelf. Not whether you believe the Bible to be true or not.\n\n   I'm going to come back to this in the weeks ahead.\n\n   Let me see if I can give you an example. One of the questions that\nhas persistently come up in the discussion group has to do with what\nJesus' view on violence might be. This has been raised since the events\nof 9/11. What would Jesus have us do? Does professing to be Christian\nmean trying to live as Christ might live? And if so, why aren't we\ndoing what he asks us to do?\n\n   First of all, I confess I have not a clue what Jesus would do in\nresponse to 9/11. My hunch is not much. His interest was not in that\nsort of thing. Besides, he had little political power.\n\n   If we went to him and asked, I think he would probably tell a story.\nHe might tell the story of the Good Iranian Terrorist. That's what the\nparable of the Good Samaritan sounded like to the people of his time.\n\n   \""Who are you he might ask?\"" Then tell a story to us as we stand\nthere with our mouths open and scratching our heads.\n\n   Maybe he would tell a story like this:\n\n   One day a rabbi, in a frenzy of religious passion, rushed in before\nthe ark, fell to his knees, and started beating his breast, crying,\n\""I'm nobody! I'm nobody!\"" The cantor of the synagogue, impressed by\nthis example of spiritual humility, joined the rabbi on his knees. \""I'm\nnobody!  I'm nobody!\"" The custodian, watching from the corner, couldn't\nrestrain himself, either. He joined the other two on his knees, calling\nout, \""I'm nobody! I'm nobody!\"" At which point the rabbi, nudging the\ncantor with his elbow, pointed at the custodian and said, \""Look who\nthinks he's nobody!\""\n\n   I'll tell you something that might be misunderstood. I think that\none of the numbers that organized religion has done on us is to\nconvince us that we are supposed to be like Jesus. What God is\ninterested in is saving human beings. That being the case what we must\ndo is be human. The Christian conspiracy, I'm going to call it, against\nbeing human is to convince us that what we are supposed to do is be\nlike Jesus.\n\n   A couple of years ago there was a popular slogan: WWJD. The goal was\nto ask before doing any and everything, \""What would Jesus do?\""\n\n   If Jesus were here today, would he have worked for Enron? Would he\nhave been on the board of directors? If Jesus were here today, would he\ngo to church? Which one? The image that I had of Jesus when I grew up\nwas that Jesus would not go to movies on Sunday but he would go\nswimming because we had a lot of water in our town. Would he be a\nRepublican or a Democrat? Would he be involved in the political\nprocess?\n\n   The one thing that Jesus Christ was about was love and he did this\nby the extravagant way that he lived his life. He wasn't married; he\ndidn't hold down a job; he didn't have to raise kids. The Roman church\nhas it that Jesus was such a guy that not only did he not have a sexual\ndimension, neither did his mother.\n\n   What Jesus was about - and still is - is Love. The extravagant way\nthat Jesus lived his life was to communicate the overwhelming love that\nGod has for us. Boundless love. Inexpressible love. It is like God\ncomes down and puts arms around us and says, \""This is how much I love\nyou. Now love yourself like that.\"" This was the thing that marked the\nministry of Jesus. So Soren Kierkegaard writes, \""To will to be that\nself which one truly is, is the opposite of despair.\""\n\n   How do you do that? Well, to be the self you truly are is to have a\nparticular history and it is to aspire to go beyond the limitations of\nthat history and it is to be frustrated when you realize you can't. To\naccept this humanness means to be passionate about our aspirations and\ncompassionate about our limitations. It is like you get up from where\nyou're sitting and come up here and stand beside me physically and look\nat the person who is seated in the chair where you are and you have\ncompassion for that person. It is that kind of acceptance.\n\n   We are not to be like Jesus. We are to be Christ-like. There is a\nworld of difference.\n\n   Jesus went around kicking self-esteem into people. All of the\nstories that you find in the New Testament are like that. Look at the\nstories of his ministry. If a man can restore sight to a blind man, he\ngives that person a new lease on life, a new self-confidence. If a man\ncan absolve a prostitute's guilt in lasting forgiveness, he gives her\nthe gift of self-respect. The crippled, the insane, the leper, the tax\ncollector, the beggar - a motley assortment of humanity desperately in\nneed of self-esteem and he extended it to them.\n\n   The same dynamic was at work even when he was chasing the\nmoneychangers out of the temple. It may be temporarily embarrassing to\nbe kicked out of your accustomed place of business, but it has been\nknown to lead to self-respect. The message is: You're made for\nsomething better than this. You are loved by God. This self-compassion\nis foundational for the abundant life and I'm sure that the response\nJesus would have us make to the terrorist situation as well as the rest\nof life is this kind of love.\n\n   He would tell a story. One of his central teachings was: You shall\nknow the Truth and the Truth shall set you free. (But first it's going\nto mess with your life and upset you!) So, let me tell you a story\nabout Truth to ponder. This story is from the Ethiopian culture.\n\n   Long ago, Fire, Water, Truth, and Falsehood lived together in one\nlarge house. Although all were polite toward each other, they kept\ntheir distance. Truth and Falsehood sat on opposite sides of the room.\nFire constantly leapt out of Water's path.\n\n   One day they went hunting together. They found a large number of\ncattle and began driving them home to their village. \""Let us share\nthese cattle equally,\"" said Truth as they traveled across the\ngrasslands. \""This is the fair way to divine our captives.\""\n\n   No one disagreed with Truth except Falsehood. Falsehood wanted more\nthan an equal share but kept quiet about it for the moment. As the four\nhunters traveled back to the Village, Falsehood went secretly to Water\nand whispered, \""You are more powerful than Fire. Destroy Fire and then\nthere will be more cattle for each of us!\""\n\n   Water flowed over Fire, bubbling and steaming until Fire was gone.\nWater meandered along, cheerfully thinking about more cattle for\nitself.\n\n   Falsehood, meanwhile, whispered to Truth. \""Look! See for yourself!\nWater has killed Fire! Let us leave Water, who has cruelly destroyed\nour warmhearted friend. We must take the cattle high in the mountains\nto graze.\""\n\n   As Truth and Falsehood traveled up the mountain, Water tried to\nfollow. But the mountain was too steep; And Water could not flow\nupwards. Water washed down upon itself, splashing and swirling around\nrocks as it tumbled down the slope. Look and see! Water is still\ntumbling down the mountainside to this day.\n\n   Truth and Falsehood arrived at the mountaintop. Falsehood turned to\nTruth and said in a loud voice, \""I am more powerful than you! You will\nbe my servant. I am your master. All the cattle belong to me!\""\n\n   Truth rose up and spoke out, \""I will not be your servant!\""\n\n   They battled and battled. Finally they brought the argument to Wind\nto decide who was the master.\n\n   Wind didn't know. Wind blew all over the world to ask people whether\nTruth or Falsehood was more powerful. Some people said, \""A single word\nof Falsehood can completely destroy Truth.\"" Others insisted, \""Like a\nsmall candle in the dark, Truth can change every situation.\""\n\n   Wind finally returned to the mountain and said, \""I have seen that\nFalsehood is very powerful. But it can rule only where Truth has\nstopped struggling to be heard.\""\n\n   And it has been that way ever since.\n\n   I think what Jesus would do if we asked him what we are to do is\nthat he would likely tell a story. And then he would remind us that we\nourselves are telling a story with our lives. After saying that,\nperhaps he would ask, \""Is the story you are telling with your life the\ntruth?\""\n\n   No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember\nthis: You are carrying precious cargo.

Open Seaso=\nn is a process in which customers interested in acquiring natural gas stora=\nge capacity in a storage facility, and/or transmission capacity on a pipeli=\nne, submit bids setting out the terms under which they will agree to purcha=\nse the capacity.     Upon completion of the project, the Desert Crossing sy=\nstem will include a 10 billion cubic foot, high-deliverability natural gas =\nstorage complex and associated pipeline, located in the Hualapai Valley, no=\nrth of Kingman, Arizona.  The associated pipeline, spanning roughly 300 mil=\nes from outside of Las Vegas to Southwestern Arizona, is projected to be an=\n 800 million cubic feet per day system that will connect the storage comple=\nx with all of the major interstate natural gas pipelines in Arizona and sou=\nthern Nevada (see map of proposed system at http://www.desert-crossing.com =\n).     Project sponsors Allegheny Energy Supply Company, the generation and=\n trading subsidiary of Allegheny Energy, Inc. (NYSE: AYE ); Salt River Proj=\nect (SRP); and Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE =\n), said that Desert Crossing will provide a consumer-driven, market-respons=\nive storage and pipeline system to serve the growing needs of the southwest=\nern United States for power and peak period gas supplies. Limitations on na=\ntural gas transportation and storage in Arizona and southern Nevada, along =\nwith past and projected increases in gas demand by consumers in the region,=\n have resulted in market conditions that make this storage and pipeline pro=\nject attractive.     \""As proposed, this project with its north-south pipeli=\nne configuration will be uniquely situated to increase shippers' and consum=\ners' options for sourcing natural gas and to provide new transportation cap=\nacity to the Arizona and southern Nevada markets,\"" commented Michael Morrel=\nl, president, Allegheny Energy Supply Company. \""The increased storage and t=\nransportation capacity will enhance energy reliability at cost-effective pr=\nices, which is good news for consumers and shippers of natural gas.\""      S=\nRP's associate general manager of power, construction & engineering, David =\nAreghini, concurred.  \""As we continue to diversify our fuel sources by addi=\nng new gas-fired power plants, it is important that we increase our ability=\n to obtain the necessary amount of natural gas supplies.  The Desert Crossi=\nng project will help ensure an economical and clean energy source for consu=\nmers and others in the Southwest for many years.\""     \""The additional natur=\nal gas supplies will help balance the region's escalating energy demands, e=\nspecially those of electric generators, as well as provide the potential to=\n help reduce future price spikes in the Southwest,\"" said Dwain Boettcher, v=\nice president of planning and analysis for Sempra Energy Resources. \""The ho=\nurly scheduling flexibility built into the proposed tariff was designed to =\ntransform the way storage service is offered in the future.\""     Customers =\nparticipating in the Open Season and awarded capacity will have unprecedent=\ned flexibility with respect to gaining access to the markets and diverse ga=\ns supplies in the Southwest.  These customers will be able to optimize thei=\nr portfolios, because Desert Crossing will be situated at the Southwest's e=\nnergy crossroads.     The project is subject to obtaining all necessary reg=\nulatory approvals and sufficient commitments from third parties during the =\nOpen Season. Project scope and costs will be announced at the conclusion of=\n the Open Season.

In addition, Husband 1.0\nuninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9,and installed\nundesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0.\n\nConversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes\nthe system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to\nno avail. What can I do?\n\nDesperate\n\n> >---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Desperate,\n\nFirst, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package,\nwhile Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Install Tears 6.2 and enter the\ncommand <C:\\ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>.\n\nHusband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and\nFlowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to\nGrumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad\nprogram that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files.\n\nDO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend\nprogram. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.\n\nIn summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a\nlimited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider\nbuying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend\nHot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9.\n\nGood luck.\n"", ""I will be out of the office until Monday, November 26th."", ""Lindy,\n\nCould you tell me how many of the operating agreements below you have a copy of?

Open Seaso=\nn is a process in which customers interested in acquiring natural gas stora=\nge capacity in a storage facility, and/or transmission capacity on a pipeli=\nne, submit bids setting out the terms under which they will agree to purcha=\nse the capacity.     Upon completion of the project, the Desert Crossing sy=\nstem will include a 10 billion cubic foot, high-deliverability natural gas =\nstorage complex and associated pipeline, located in the Hualapai Valley, no=\nrth of Kingman, Arizona.  The associated pipeline, spanning roughly 300 mil=\nes from outside of Las Vegas to Southwestern Arizona, is projected to be an=\n 800 million cubic feet per day system that will connect the storage comple=\nx with all of the major interstate natural gas pipelines in Arizona and sou=\nthern Nevada (see map of proposed system at http://www.desert-crossing.com =\n).     Project sponsors Allegheny Energy Supply Company, the generation and=\n trading subsidiary of Allegheny Energy, Inc. (NYSE: AYE ); Salt River Proj=\nect (SRP); and Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE =\n), said that Desert Crossing will provide a consumer-driven, market-respons=\nive storage and pipeline system to serve the growing needs of the southwest=\nern United States for power and peak period gas supplies. Limitations on na=\ntural gas transportation and storage in Arizona and southern Nevada, along =\nwith past and projected increases in gas demand by consumers in the region,=\n have resulted in market conditions that make this storage and pipeline pro=\nject attractive.     \""As proposed, this project with its north-south pipeli=\nne configuration will be uniquely situated to increase shippers' and consum=\ners' options for sourcing natural gas and to provide new transportation cap=\nacity to the Arizona and southern Nevada markets,\"" commented Michael Morrel=\nl, president, Allegheny Energy Supply Company. \""The increased storage and t=\nransportation capacity will enhance energy reliability at cost-effective pr=\nices, which is good news for consumers and shippers of natural gas.\""      S=\nRP's associate general manager of power, construction & engineering, David =\nAreghini, concurred.  \""As we continue to diversify our fuel sources by addi=\nng new gas-fired power plants, it is important that we increase our ability=\n to obtain the necessary amount of natural gas supplies.  The Desert Crossi=\nng project will help ensure an economical and clean energy source for consu=\nmers and others in the Southwest for many years.\""     \""The additional natur=\nal gas supplies will help balance the region's escalating energy demands, e=\nspecially those of electric generators, as well as provide the potential to=\n help reduce future price spikes in the Southwest,\"" said Dwain Boettcher, v=\nice president of planning and analysis for Sempra Energy Resources. \""The ho=\nurly scheduling flexibility built into the proposed tariff was designed to =\ntransform the way storage service is offered in the future.\""     Customers =\nparticipating in the Open Season and awarded capacity will have unprecedent=\ned flexibility with respect to gaining access to the markets and diverse ga=\ns supplies in the Southwest.  These customers will be able to optimize thei=\nr portfolios, because Desert Crossing will be situated at the Southwest's e=\nnergy crossroads.     The project is subject to obtaining all necessary reg=\nulatory approvals and sufficient commitments from third parties during the =\nOpen Season.

GMS views a late chart as a chart that is not in their possession by COB on the 3rd working day of the month.   In further discussions with the GSM employees and Gary Anderson it was confirmed that they do not have any idea how many charts were late for the December close.  They also cannot produce a report reflecting when charts were received.\n\nThe PGAS program can has a chart tracking feature that requires each chart to have a bar code label and that GMS read the bar code when charts are received. Use of this process for all charts and index cards would provide a report of those charts that are late.  Two reports could be generated, one at COB on the third business day of each month and again as a part of the final close.  This process would tell us monthly where we have issues but to date it apparently has not been used. \n\nI have requested that Gary Anderson, for January business, provide through the PGAS report or other means a report by customer of the late charts.  These would be the charts that should be in the hands of GMS by the close of business on February 5.  This report should provide us with an idea of where we stand in respect to the late chart issue.  We will also request that GMS to mandate the use of the PGAS report to track receipt of charts going forward even after we have initiated the new mailing process.

(The SLA Settlement reduces the rates that have been in effect since June, 2001, but it doesn't roll them back  to the RP98-302 rate case rates.)\n\nThe timing & process will be similar to what we did in August, 1999.\n\nI would put the revised rates into TRS right after the February Commodity Invoices go out (around 3/12).\nThe rates will be effective back to 11/1/2001.  We will repath 4 months with several iterations to check discounts and adjust manuals.\nFuel is unaffected.  Storage contracts shouldn't be affected, either.\n\nWe will use the February Commodity PPA cycle for the Commodity part of the refund.\nWe will use the March Reservation PPA for the Reservation part of the refund.\nWe would probably mail the refund PPA invoices at the end of March, just before the March Reservation Invoices go out on April 1.\nThe refund dollars would hit the 3/2002 GL.\n\nIf we follow the same plan as 8/99, then commodity PPAs will be shut off after the current, 1/2002 commodity invoices.\nAny non-SLA related PPAs would have to wait until the March Commodity invoice cycle in April.\nIf there are pending PPAs that need to be released in this invoice cycle, it would be a good idea to do so.\n\nI'll resurrect the August, 1999 schedule and modify it later in the week.  Then, we can schedule a preliminary meeting to figure out what needs to happen.\n\nIf someone protests the SLA order in the next month, this schedule would be delayed, but we should probably start getting things in place.\n""]","[""2001-11-06 09:48:49"", ""2001-11-15 20:17:35"", ""2001-11-16 16:13:41"", ""2001-11-19 19:02:52"", ""2001-11-29 19:23:17"", ""2001-12-07 12:04:06"", ""2001-12-07 19:59:47"", ""2001-12-26 09:34:09"", ""2001-12-28 18:33:55"", ""2002-01-02 17:44:34"", ""2002-01-08 20:33:02"", ""2002-01-10 09:30:31"", ""2002-01-10 15:53:06"", ""2002-01-14 09:51:06"", ""2002-01-14 10:03:34"", ""2002-01-15 21:34:50"", ""2002-01-16 16:13:20"", ""2002-01-25 13:19:37"", ""2002-01-29 09:37:58"", ""2002-01-31 19:55:39"", ""2002-02-04 13:54:23"", ""2002-02-05 12:35:43"", ""2002-02-06 14:31:52"", ""2002-02-13 13:17:41"", ""2002-02-15 11:40:30"", ""2001-10-01 19:02:56"", ""2001-11-15 16:04:01"", ""2001-11-20 16:15:38"", ""2001-11-20 18:33:21"", ""2001-11-20 20:25:33"", ""2001-11-28 14:55:28"", ""2001-12-06 18:51:42"", ""2002-01-09 11:06:57"", ""2002-01-10 11:23:14"", ""2002-01-18 10:55:45"", ""2002-02-04 12:57:37"", ""2002-02-15 11:19:30"", ""2002-02-15 18:29:34""]"

Open Seaso=\nn is a process in which customers interested in acquiring natural gas stora=\nge capacity in a storage facility, and/or transmission capacity on a pipeli=\nne, submit bids setting out the terms under which they will agree to purcha=\nse the capacity.     Upon completion of the project, the Desert Crossing sy=\nstem will include a 10 billion cubic foot, high-deliverability natural gas =\nstorage complex and associated pipeline, located in the Hualapai Valley, no=\nrth of Kingman, Arizona.  The associated pipeline, spanning roughly 300 mil=\nes from outside of Las Vegas to Southwestern Arizona, is projected to be an=\n 800 million cubic feet per day system that will connect the storage comple=\nx with all of the major interstate natural gas pipelines in Arizona and sou=\nthern Nevada (see map of proposed system at http://www.desert-crossing.com =\n).     Project sponsors Allegheny Energy Supply Company, the generation and=\n trading subsidiary of Allegheny Energy, Inc. (NYSE: AYE ); Salt River Proj=\nect (SRP); and Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE =\n), said that Desert Crossing will provide a consumer-driven, market-respons=\nive storage and pipeline system to serve the growing needs of the southwest=\nern United States for power and peak period gas supplies. Limitations on na=\ntural gas transportation and storage in Arizona and southern Nevada, along =\nwith past and projected increases in gas demand by consumers in the region,=\n have resulted in market conditions that make this storage and pipeline pro=\nject attractive.     \""As proposed, this project with its north-south pipeli=\nne configuration will be uniquely situated to increase shippers' and consum=\ners' options for sourcing natural gas and to provide new transportation cap=\nacity to the Arizona and southern Nevada markets,\"" commented Michael Morrel=\nl, president, Allegheny Energy Supply Company. \""The increased storage and t=\nransportation capacity will enhance energy reliability at cost-effective pr=\nices, which is good news for consumers and shippers of natural gas.\""      S=\nRP's associate general manager of power, construction & engineering, David =\nAreghini, concurred.  \""As we continue to diversify our fuel sources by addi=\nng new gas-fired power plants, it is important that we increase our ability=\n to obtain the necessary amount of natural gas supplies.  The Desert Crossi=\nng project will help ensure an economical and clean energy source for consu=\nmers and others in the Southwest for many years.\""     \""The additional natur=\nal gas supplies will help balance the region's escalating energy demands, e=\nspecially those of electric generators, as well as provide the potential to=\n help reduce future price spikes in the Southwest,\"" said Dwain Boettcher, v=\nice president of planning and analysis for Sempra Energy Resources. \""The ho=\nurly scheduling flexibility built into the proposed tariff was designed to =\ntransform the way storage service is offered in the future.\""     Customers =\nparticipating in the Open Season and awarded capacity will have unprecedent=\ned flexibility with respect to gaining access to the markets and diverse ga=\ns supplies in the Southwest.  These customers will be able to optimize thei=\nr portfolios, because Desert Crossing will be situated at the Southwest's e=\nnergy crossroads.     The project is subject to obtaining all necessary reg=\nulatory approvals and sufficient commitments from third parties during the =\nOpen Season.

In addition, Husband 1.0\nuninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9,and installed\nundesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0.\n\nConversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes\nthe system.

Install Tears 6.2 and enter the\ncommand <C:\\ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>.\n\nHusband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and\nFlowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to\nGrumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad\nprogram that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files.\n\nDO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend\nprogram. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.\n\nIn summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a\nlimited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly.

She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -\n\n1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the \""Dynegy transition\"" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven. [Geaccone, Tracy]  The lower capital is probably from the revised plan.  I am okey with the other assumption. \n2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers? [Geaccone, Tracy]  Costs have been reduced due to Dynegy transition.  If we assume under our control, costs would be the same or slightly lower.  I would propose the same for now. \n3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the \""contract roll off\"" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative. [Geaccone, Tracy]    I think this is a good assumption \n4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more \""reasonable\"" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. \n5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.\n\nAny thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.\n\nThanks,\nKevin"", ""Things are ok.

(ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could\nreceive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s\n(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday\nby the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,\n2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full\ncalendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he\nterminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. \n  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the\nresignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that\ntime, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. \n  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any\nrelated tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an \""excess\nparachute payment,\"" according to the filing. \n  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. \n  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is\nentitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment\nwithin the 60 days. \n  Houston-based Enron is a utilities and communications company. -Dan Lowrey;\nDow Jones Newswires; 202-393-7402; dan.lowrey@dowjones.com \n \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires  13-11-01\n  1428GMT(AP-DJ-11-13-01 1428GMT)\n\nSymbols:\n  US;DYN US;ENE \n\n  13-Nov-2001  14:28:54 GMT\nSource DJES   - Dow Jones Energy Service\nCategories:\n  I/ELC I/GAS I/UES I/XISL N/CNW N/DJWI N/DPG N/LNG N/NRG N/WEI M/NND M/UTI\n  P/NRG R/NAPW R/NERC R/NME R/TX R/US R/USS MST/I/ELC MST/I/GAS MST/I MST/N/LNG\n  MST/R/NME MST/R/US/TX MST/R/US "", ""all i can say is \""house of cards\""\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tLandry, Chad  \nSent:\tWednesday, November 14, 2001 10:37 AM\nTo:\tBlanchard, Timothy; Bass, Eric; Lenhart, Matthew\nSubject:\twhat are teh odds\n\nof this merger not going through?  a pwr trader that reliant's ice (trading platform) is having record breaking days.  just glad i never believed the \""hype'\n\nckl\n\n "", ""really?  maybe it was based on time.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tBass, Eric  \nSent:\tTuesday, February 05, 2002 2:38 PM\nTo:\tLenhart, Matthew\nSubject:\tRE: \n\nwell i know that charlie was promoted and he hasn't done jack\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tLenhart, Matthew  \nSent:\tTuesday, February 05, 2002 2:37 PM\nTo:\tBass, Eric\nSubject:\tRE: \n\ni don't think jay was promoted.  actually i heard very few people were promoted.  i am not sure about him though.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tBass, Eric  \nSent:\tTuesday, February 05, 2002 2:36 PM\nTo:\tLenhart, Matthew\nSubject:\tRE: \n\nno i am just hearing that most everyone got promoted\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tLenhart, Matthew  \nSent:\tTuesday, February 05, 2002 2:35 PM\nTo:\tBass, Eric\nSubject:\tRE: \n\ni have no idea.  did you hear he was?\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tBass, Eric  \nSent:\tTuesday, February 05, 2002 2:32 PM\nTo:\tLenhart, Matthew\nSubject:\tRE: \n\njust wondering - mainly i was wondering if matt smith is a manager now?\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tLenhart, Matthew  \nSent:\tTuesday, February 05, 2002 2:30 PM\nTo:\tBass, Eric\nSubject:\tRE: \n\ni don't know.  why?\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tBass, Eric  \nSent:\tTuesday, February 05, 2002 2:22 PM\nTo:\tLenhart, Matthew\nSubject:\tRE: \n\nwho all got promoted on your desk?\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tLenhart, Matthew  \nSent:\tMonday, February 04, 2002 10:27 AM\nTo:\tBlanchard, Timothy; Bass, Eric; O'Malley, Justin; 'val.generes@accenture.com'; 'kevin.a.boone@accenture.com'\nSubject:\tFW: \n\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tBhatia, Randy  \nSent:\tMonday, February 04, 2002 10:00 AM\nTo:\tWolfe, Jason; Lenhart, Matthew\nSubject:\t\n\n\n\nhttp://www.bol.ucla.edu/~rahjr79/ninja.htm"", ""you owe $80 for the league.  $120 for dues minus $40 for winning the league pool one week.\ndo you agree?"", ""If you haven't paid your dues by Sunday you will begin to forfeit.

I made this extremely simple on our first pass, but I left in the tabs that were in the old/current file.  All you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locations(yellow column).  This will then set the gas daily curve.  We will continue to true up to gas daily each day.  You may want to also reset the next day's curve as well, since this is a hardcode, you simply type over the previous day's load.  The phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it.  We can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like.

I made this extremely simple on our first pass, but I left in the tabs that were in the old/current file.  All you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locations(yellow column).  This will then set the gas daily curve.  We will continue to true up to gas daily each day.  You may want to also reset the next day's curve as well, since this is a hardcode, you simply type over the previous day's load.  The phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it.  We can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like.  I figure you will want to keep your model and I can pull info from there as well.  I simply wanted to start out at a baseline and build it to best fit your needs.

My feelings are for continuity that all operations involving trading and scheduling of physical gas should move here under your firm control and direction.

Thanks to each of you who=\n are leaving for all you have done.\n\nAs to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =\nme that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=\nctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =\nability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee=\nd to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all =\nU.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, =\nJim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j=\nointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of =\nthe group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h=\nelp Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=\ndership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=\nty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =\nbe led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La=\nst, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o=\nn California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part=\n of the Wholesale electricity team).\n\nSteve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =\ndevelopment effort along with Dan Allegretti.\n\nWith the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=\n a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=\nislative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=\nill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=\n will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=\nelopment efforts across the U.S.\n\nMuch of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti=\nnue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, =\ntaking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi=\nm will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con=\ntinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over su=\npport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market=\ns, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue=\n to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government=\n affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout=\nh America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts=\n, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.\n\nI am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs =\nto provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Comm=\nittee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman,=\n Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord=\n, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also con=\ntinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry King=\nerski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am form=\ning a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of =\nJose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself=\n.\n\nNo organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf=\nect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more pre=\npared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as th=\ne future unfolds for the company.\n\nOne final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through =\nthis uncertain and troubled period for the company.  We are all saddened by=\n the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr=\noup fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each othe=\nr and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, f=\nor those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excelle=\nnce and integrity that has characterized our group.  Personally, I will do =\nall I can, for as long as I can, to steer the group through this to the ver=\ny best place possible.  Your continued dedication and support is very much =\nappreciated.  Hang in there and thanks.\n\n""]","[""2001-10-10 12:51:16"", ""2001-12-26 14:32:32"", ""2001-10-03 18:10:43"", ""2001-10-05 17:21:39"", ""2001-10-15 19:59:13"", ""2001-10-24 10:53:19"", ""2001-10-24 20:36:59"", ""2001-10-24 23:27:28"", ""2001-10-31 10:57:26"", ""2001-11-05 15:56:36"", ""2001-11-08 16:07:53"", ""2001-11-15 16:41:44"", ""2001-11-16 17:49:46"", ""2001-11-16 19:23:43"", ""2001-11-27 12:43:32"", ""2001-11-27 22:10:53"", ""2001-12-04 19:11:41"", ""2001-12-06 17:40:10"", ""2001-12-07 12:55:03"", ""2001-12-10 11:13:49"", ""2001-12-14 19:24:14"", ""2001-12-14 19:31:04"", ""2002-01-02 20:27:26"", ""2002-01-18 16:52:41""]"

I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.

To this end we will be seeking to cut our headcount in Europe by between five and ten percent, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance.

However, if we are to maintain growth levels, we need to focus very closely on our cost base and create more efficiencies in the current round of Enron Corp. budget reviews.\n\nWe are analysing much more closely exactly which businesses we derive our earnings from and concentrating our resources on those areas.  We will be taking decisions to put some projects on the \""back burner\""and reduce the scope of others.\n\nThis will inevitably mean that we need to reduce our headcount both in commercial and commercial support groups as we seek to identify the best mix of skills to keep us on our earnings growth track.  To this end we will be seeking to cut our headcount in Europe by between five and ten percent, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance.  Details of this program will be made available by Monday 8th October.  We hope to complete this exercise and communicate the outcome as quickly as possible in October so that everyone knows where they stand.\n\nPlease feel free to contact either of us, but also talk to your supervisor about any specific concerns you may have and remember that you can also make use of the LifeWorks confidential counselling service that is available on 0800 169 1920.\n\nWe firmly believe that if we work hard together now to achieve these short term goals, we will create a stronger, more flexible team at Enron which will be better placed than ever to grow our business in Europe.\n\nJohn Sherriff and Michael Brown"", ""FYI\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tMcMichael Jr., Ed  \nSent:\tWednesday, December 12, 2001 12:56 PM\nTo:\tAllen, Phillip K.; Grigsby, Mike; Shively, Hunter S.; Neal, Scott; Martin, Thomas A.; Tomaski, Richard; Arnold, John; Griffith, John\nSubject:\tCurves\n\nUntil further notice, please set (and/or have your traders set) all of the curves to market representative numbers each day.

Do you contemplate that Netco would trade those commodities/products?  Bob Hall's team that he has assembled for Netco does not include anyone with either Weather or Crude operations experience.  \n\nWe retained two top-notch operations individuals - Todd Hall and Kevin Sweeney - who at this time are not on the list for Netco.  Both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations - documentation, risk books and settlements.  Todd and Kevin each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details.\n\nTodd has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for Weather.  Prior to has role in EGM, Todd created the MPR and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio.  He also has had extensive experience in gas risk management.   \n\nSweeney's most recent assignment has been to manage operations for EIM.

(The tabs total 184 with one Associate noted on a separate line in Power Logistics, and 183 without that Associate, so I don't know whether you are using 183 or 184 currently for the Operations total.) Taking this number to 100 in total is obviously a big change - 45.6% reduction.  At this moment, I don't know how feasible that is.  But I will work with Jeff, Stacey and Leslie to find out.\n \nWe  need some questions answered first to go through this:\n \n1)  Who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for Gas and Power Logistics?  Together, those groups represent 25% of the 184 headcount.  Going in, I would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions - should be 21 reductions.  We need to know who we should work with to coordinate this.  Need names and weekend contact numbers.\n \n2)  What will the overall headcount be for Netco?  What we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes.  If commercial numbers don't change and the business scope doesn't change, a 45.6% reduction is probably out of the question.  \n \n3)  Is the 100 number for Operations only a start-up number?  Could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up, approval is obtained for physical gas business, etc.?  Or is the 100 number intended to be the total headcount for all of 2002?\n \n4)  What are UBS' expectations for mid and back office?  What are the views from Legal and UBS on creating confirmations for EOL transactions?  There were some discussions with Leslie Reeves about not confirming certain types of transactions.  One firm, and I don't remember whether it was UBS or not, mentioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions, and that instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations.  That is a completely different activity than we normally engage in, and would make a difference in staffing - perhaps requiring more people!   We need to know those things from UBS to take a real stab at a revised number.  Should we just pool our knowledge from various discussions that have been had with UBS, or is there someone with UBS that we should be talking with this weekend to get there view of what is required?\n \n5)  Does the internal RAC group go forward under a headcount reduction - i.e. will we be coordinating and providing information to them, or will UBS assume some of their functions?  This may impact our staffing needs.  What about consolidated risk reporting - will Stacey and Jeff simply transmit data to UBS, or Netco have to provide some consolidated risk reporting before sending info to UBS?\n \nWe may have more questions, but these are key now to get at a feasible number.  \n \n--Sally \n "", ""Sally,\n\nJohn Postlethwaite, Donnie Vinson and Casey Evans all have the title of Associate Director.

Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.\n\nI would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.\n\nCommunication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.\n\nIf you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.\n\nHappy New Year\n\nLouise"", ""I won't be able to attend the meeting on Friday.

Given this we need to make some decisions as to how to best handle these=\n services agreements.  Here are some suggestions:\n\nPeggy Hedstrom, in Calgary would like to assign the Enron Canada Master Ser=\nvices agreements to NETCO and continue to service those via that entity.\n\nBridgeline, which is a JV in which ENA owns a 40% interest, currently has n=\no way that they can support themselves.  They are totally dependent on Enro=\nn for everything from email, internet, network services and office applicat=\nions as well as trading, risk and back office applications.  If there are c=\noncerns about the estate's ability to support Bridgeline then it may be in =\nEnron's best interest to assign this agreement to NETCO.\n\nAEP/HPL is more of a stand alone operation.  They have their own infrastruc=\nture in place and currently provide for their own email and office support =\nservices.  They have also brought up with their own version of our SCADA sy=\nstem and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our =\nPipeline Operations system.  If we sell them our version of PGAS to support=\n their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications =\ninto their own Trade Blotter, Open Link Financials and Altra.  Their goal w=\nas to try and have all of this in place by sometime in June of this year.  =\nGiven all of the Commercial conflicts with AEP regarding the sale of HPL it=\n may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and sugges=\nt that AEP try to be stand alone ASAP.  That way if the estate defaults on =\nthe service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information fro=\nm one system to another until they have put in their own integration betwee=\nn the applications listed above.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any comments or if it makes sense to put tog=\nether a meeting to discuss the issues of Service Agreements.\n\n =20\n\nTommy J Yanowski\nSr. Director - Enron Net Works\nWork # 713.853.6858\nCell # 713.539.7094\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Perlman, Beth =20\nSent:=09Wednesday, December 19, 2001 3:54 PM\nTo:=09Johnson, Jeff; Stock, Steve; McAuliffe, Bob\nCc:=09Webb, Jay; Yanowski, Tommy J.; Burchfield, Richard\nSubject:=09RE: Integration Test Planning / Coordination Mtg Summary\n\nThe AEP and Bridgeline deals must be investigated.

This assumes all major production data setup - users, rights, books=\n, global data - is completed and tested on a per application basis. Some co=\nde changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ens=\nure the applications still talk to each other.=20\n3) Integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactio=\nns from EOL to SAP through all core trading applications to ensure that app=\nlications and interfaces still work. We will not be testing functional perm=\nutations, data conditions, validation or exceptions to any significant degr=\nee.=20\n4) Each application conversion team must test their changes before approvin=\ng their changes for integration testing. We are operating from the premise =\nthat data, infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a applicatio=\nn system level before the enterprise integration test starts.=20\n4) All systems will be physically split (even Unify at this point).=20\n5) Integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both Es=\ntate and New Co.=20\n6) We will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and ex=\necution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to=\n support go live to production.=20\n7) We will minimize the differentiation between New Co and Estate for conve=\nrsion and test team purposes. There are two teams - Conversion and Integrat=\nion Test. Each team will focus on both Estate and New Co. Resources are too=\n tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility.=20\n8) Estate conversions must happen at the application level before New Co co=\nnversion work can begin in earnest. Estate conversion is on the critical pa=\nth for New Co.=20\n\n\nKey Issues\n1) We will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial tradi=\nng first, then physical. If financial is the focus, delivery risk goes down=\n dramatically. For now, we must plan on the worst case -- physical and fina=\nncial on Jan 20.=20\n2) We need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support A=\nEP and Bridgeline in Estate. This means that we need a dev environment (and=\n HW gap addressed) for Unify, Sitara, CPR, TAGG/ERMS. Conversion teams need=\n to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure w=\ne're in synch.=20\n3) Unify servers probably can't be owned by New Co while running a single l=\nicense of Unify.=20\n4) Some systems are using 'short name' instead of Duns ID as a key for coun=\nterparties from Global. The Global, TAGG / ERMS, Unify and SAP reps must qu=\nickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizin=\ng hard coded reference id risks.=20\n5) We must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these =\npotential dates. We must focus on core systems with only core changes requi=\nred to support day one trading.=20\n6) We can only convert Estate over the weekend due to AEP / Bridgeline cons=\niderations.

All went well.   The CFO asked about performance measurements regarding costs per transaction.  I described the Operations Pricing Model that I implemented several years ago.  They were also interested in our ability to handle increased transaction flow, and I mentioned that through the OPM we were able to track the increased operational efficiencies that we experienced with the increase in transaction flow.  The CFO asked to get some information regarding OPM.  I have a summary report that reflects the decrease in cost per transaction plotted against the increase in transaction counts.  This is not currently included in the data room.   Do you want to review this before I pass it along to Andy Zipper to provide to the CFO?  \n\n\nUBS:\n\nEddie Pittarelli (Head of Operations for UBS) called today to reconfirm the numbers of operations personnel slated for Newco.  The spreadsheets that you had forwarded to me Louise (through Amy Fitzpatrick on December 19) totaled 172 for Operations, which included 32 for Gas Logistics.  Eddie said that he was going into a meeting tonight where UBS would again discuss their level of interest.  He wanted to know if the Operations staff was still primarily in tact, and I confirmed that is the case.  Told him that the leads on Gas Risk, Gas Logistics, Power Risk, Settlements and Documentation were all here in place.  He said that depending on the outcome of the meeting tonight that he plans to be in Houston within the next few days.  FYI.

We have already identified our lower performers across Operations and IT as well.  We had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting EIM and EGM who could potentially support EA and EES in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units.  \n\nThe above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from Jenny Rub, which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings).  The estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that may result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter.  \n\nYour desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible.

So, it's imperative that someone from Northern very closely monitor the situation with ENA and Midland to ensure that ENA makes the necessary payments. In addition, the bankruptcy court may require ENA to provide Midland with \""adequate assurance\"" of future payments.

($88,816.33) and Nov. ($39,881.55) Midland Power Coop electric bills to ENA have not been paid, and probably won't be until the bankruptcy proceeding unfolds (if at all).\n3)  Under bankruptcy law, a utility cannot discontinue service to a debtor for not paying invoices outstanding at the time bankruptcy is filed and Bill Rapp has asked ENA's bankruptcy attorneys to provide the attached notice to Midlands Power Cooperative.\n4)  Under supervision of the bankruptcy court, future invoices received after bankruptcy was filed (Dec 2) will be paid by ENA (if they have the cash?).\n5)  ENA's nomination of 2,010 dth/d of \""Monthly Fuel Gas Payable\"" from NNG has been confirmed and is flowing.  (This is their source of cash!?)\n6)  Gas Accounting will continue to pay the \""Monthly Demand Charge\"" ($64,549), and the \""Monthly Peak Compression Service Charges\"" (ranges from $300 to $40,000).  The next payment is not due until the end of December.\n7)  ENA's O&M payment to NNG for motor operation ($4,072.82) will be billed on the 20th of each month.  One month's payment should have been outstanding when bankruptcy was filed and therefore not paid, however, it was actually paid to NNG on Dec. 6th.\n8)  ENA's next $320,000 \""Peak Associated Payment\"" is not due to NNG until July 1, 2002.\n\nThere is no certainty when dealing with a bankrupt entity, however, this is where we are today.

Frazier wasn't entirely comfortable with having Andy Fastow in that role in the first place since he may have had access to transportation/capacity information in his capacity as CFO of Enron Corp. The same concern would, of course apply to Andy Fastow's successor. That was why Frazier had suggested Cindy Olsen. I spoke with Mary Kay and told her about this concern. She understands, but continues to feel that we should be able to come up with someone who is more substantively involved in Enron's underlying businesses but who does not have access to transportation/capacity information. I'll work with Frazier to see if we can identify someone. So, let's hold off for now in contacting Jeff McMahon. I'll keep you updated.

Among other things, I'll be handling Northern Natural's compliance with the marketing affiliate rule. \n\nAn issue has come up with Northern as a result of the recent changes at Enron Corp.\n\nAndy Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as \""President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division\"".  Apparently, he was named to this position because he was not an officer or director of one of our marketing affiliates and was also not an officer or director of Northern. This satisfied the requirements of the marketing affilate rule. Given recent personnel changes at Enron Corp., it's now necessary to find a replacement for Andy Fastow. Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.

Global will have to repush the NetCo data before the testing.\n\nSchedule for Wednesday 01/23 (complete set of scenarios to be tested)\n(1) By 11:00am - all IT systems to have deleted any estate data & backups completed\n(2) 11:00am - Global to repush any setup data if needed\n(3) 12:00pm - global data setup by users\n(4) 1:00pm - 5:00pm User integration test of all test scenarios.

EOL passed us 25 Gas and 40 power scenarios of which we tested a subset of transactions.  Today's test went a bit smoother given we pushed for the counterparties, contracts to be setup in advance.  We will continue with the Gas settlement on Tuesday morning, along with SAP processing at 1:00pm.\n \nFrom a technical code perspective, there were no major interface issues.  Including TDS/ Sitara interface to Tagg as discussed earlier.\nErrors reported include continued NT userid \""pilot burn-in\"" issues, as well as replication issues with data.  Given we are processing in a very 'truncated' environment, downstream systems can have missing global data needed (regions, facilities, SAP information).  The open issues are being escalated and should be addressed by 10:00am tomorrow morning.\n \nThe goals of this regression test on Monday/ Tuesday are:\n1) regression test a subset of scenarios (ie Physical Gas Sale, Physical Power Supply, Financial Swap, Intercomapny) now that the Global Data is more stable (UBS internal counterparties, profit centers, desks/ books) \n2) Identify any reference to internal/ external screens that still have 'ENRON' reference, or 'EOL' reference\n3) Ensure we have the latest price curve data from updates (ie TAGG/ERMS)\n4) process new EOL data created for Monday.  To verify mid/ back office, including SAP processing.   EOL will also push data from a mock trading session for on 2/7 (see below) \n5) provide the test data scenarios for SAP testing (scheduled Tuesday 1pm).  SAP is completing their setup with the new controlling area for NetCo. \n6) Continue with NT Logins involved with PILOT until remaining are ported.\n \n \nAccomplishments/  what worked?\n1) Confirmation/ updates of most recent price curves into ERMS.  The data prior was from mid December.\n2) Working with only the subset of counterparties as authorized as 'Active'\n3) EOL deals did flow downstream.  However, the major were future periods that we cannot settle.  We modified the data to correspond to what downstream needed.\n4) Gas - Volume Management, Logistics, and leading into Settlement\n5) Power/ Financial  - EnPower/ Tagg, confirmations, leading into settlement\n \n \nWhat did not?\n1) Canada testing is still catching up, but improving.  They are identifying the counterparties, pipelines, test scenarios and anticipate continuing to test Tuesday.   \n2) Facilities missing, Canada pipelines missing, contracts not replicating into Unify (resolved). \n3) Unify Tagg Deal Load.  The Unify Tagg Deal load was discovered at 5pm, and will be addressed early Tuesday am.\n \nFocus on Tuesday\nGiven the new SAP environment has not been tested to date, we will monitor the Unify transmission/ SAP processing (scheduled for 1pm till).  \nThere is much risk within SAP given the new counterparties, entities, xref tables, SAP information is just being setup.  We will also validate the intercompany transactions created on Monday.\n \nNote:  Tuesday night (6pm - 8pm) is the scheduled NetCo test with Estate Shutdown.\n \nAttachments to provide more detail:\n    Integration Testing ISSUES.xls (see tab page for 0204)\n    0204 Global Data Setup AND transactions.xls  (See tab page for 0204 open issues)\n \n \nRegards,\n\nRegan Smith \nEnergy Operations Systems \nEnron Net Works \n713-853-9291 (wk); 281-850-7551 (cell) \n\n "", ""yea, set up 1 for each\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tMcLaughlin Jr., Errol  \nSent:\tThursday, January 03, 2002 10:26 AM\nTo:\tArnold, John\nSubject:\tNew Books for NETCO\n\nJohn,\n\nI am setting up new books for NETCO.

These fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week. Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. \nThe design and development of these new weather products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and support for these new products.\nTo trade weather swaps you must have our new version 8 release installed on your system. An advisory with details about this new release is being sent to you by separate email. \nWe encourage all or our users to take a serious look at the new weather products being offered by the IntercontinentalExchange.

When class began, wordlessly he picked up a large  empty mayonnaise jar \nand proceeded to fill it with rocks right to the  top, rocks about 2\"" \ndiameter. \nHe then asked the students if  the jar was full? They agreed that it was.  So \nthe professor then  picked up a box of pebbles and poured them in to the jar. \nHe shook the  jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas  \nbetween the rocks.  The students laughed. He asked his students  again if the \njar was full? They agreed that yes, it was. \nThe  professor then picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of  \ncourse, the sand filled up everything else. \""Now,\"" said the professor,  \""I \nwant you to recognize that this is your life. \nThe rocks are  the important things - your family, your partner, your health, \nyour  children - anything that is so important to you that if it were lost,  \nyou would be nearly destroyed. \nThe pebbles are the other  things in life that matter, but on smaller scale. \nThe pebbles  represent things like your job, your house, your car. \nThe sand is  everything else. The small stuff. \nIf you put the sand or the  pebbles into the jar first, there is no room for \nthe rocks. The same  goes for your life. If you spend all your energy and time \non the small  stuff, material things, you will never have room for the things \nthat  are truly most important.  Pay attention to the things that are  critical \nin your life.  Play with your children. Take your  partner out dancing. There \nwill always be time to go to work, clean  the house, give a dinner party and \nfix the disposal. \""Take care of the  rocks first-the things that really \nmatter. Set your priorities.

When class began, wordlessly he picked up a large  empty mayonnaise jar \nand proceeded to fill it with rocks right to the  top, rocks about 2\"" \ndiameter. \nHe then asked the students if  the jar was full? They agreed that it was.  So \nthe professor then  picked up a box of pebbles and poured them in to the jar. \nHe shook the  jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas  \nbetween the rocks.  The students laughed. He asked his students  again if the \njar was full? They agreed that yes, it was. \nThe  professor then picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of  \ncourse, the sand filled up everything else. \""Now,\"" said the professor,  \""I \nwant you to recognize that this is your life. \nThe rocks are  the important things - your family, your partner, your health, \nyour  children - anything that is so important to you that if it were lost,  \nyou would be nearly destroyed. \nThe pebbles are the other  things in life that matter, but on smaller scale. \nThe pebbles  represent things like your job, your house, your car. \nThe sand is  everything else. The small stuff. \nIf you put the sand or the  pebbles into the jar first, there is no room for \nthe rocks. The same  goes for your life. If you spend all your energy and time \non the small  stuff, material things, you will never have room for the things \nthat  are truly most important.  Pay attention to the things that are  critical \nin your life.  Play with your children. Take your  partner out dancing. There \nwill always be time to go to work, clean  the house, give a dinner party and \nfix the disposal. \""Take care of the  rocks first-the things that really \nmatter. Set your priorities. The  rest is just pebbles and sand * Good Luck! \nI hope it works. \n*  May there always be work for your hands to do; \n* May your purse always  hold a coin or two; \n* May the sun always shine on your window pane;  \n* May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain; \n* May the hand of  a friend always be near you; \n* May God fill your heart with gladness  to cheer you. \n* An Irish Blessing  * The Friendship Bracelet  \n* O~xxxxxxx@@@@@xxxxxxx~O\"">O~xxxxxxx@@@@@xxxxxxx~O  \n* OK, this is what you have to do...Send this to ALL of  your friends!

Open Seaso=\nn is a process in which customers interested in acquiring natural gas stora=\nge capacity in a storage facility, and/or transmission capacity on a pipeli=\nne, submit bids setting out the terms under which they will agree to purcha=\nse the capacity.     Upon completion of the project, the Desert Crossing sy=\nstem will include a 10 billion cubic foot, high-deliverability natural gas =\nstorage complex and associated pipeline, located in the Hualapai Valley, no=\nrth of Kingman, Arizona.  The associated pipeline, spanning roughly 300 mil=\nes from outside of Las Vegas to Southwestern Arizona, is projected to be an=\n 800 million cubic feet per day system that will connect the storage comple=\nx with all of the major interstate natural gas pipelines in Arizona and sou=\nthern Nevada (see map of proposed system at http://www.desert-crossing.com =\n).     Project sponsors Allegheny Energy Supply Company, the generation and=\n trading subsidiary of Allegheny Energy, Inc. (NYSE: AYE ); Salt River Proj=\nect (SRP); and Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE =\n), said that Desert Crossing will provide a consumer-driven, market-respons=\nive storage and pipeline system to serve the growing needs of the southwest=\nern United States for power and peak period gas supplies. Limitations on na=\ntural gas transportation and storage in Arizona and southern Nevada, along =\nwith past and projected increases in gas demand by consumers in the region,=\n have resulted in market conditions that make this storage and pipeline pro=\nject attractive.     \""As proposed, this project with its north-south pipeli=\nne configuration will be uniquely situated to increase shippers' and consum=\ners' options for sourcing natural gas and to provide new transportation cap=\nacity to the Arizona and southern Nevada markets,\"" commented Michael Morrel=\nl, president, Allegheny Energy Supply Company. \""The increased storage and t=\nransportation capacity will enhance energy reliability at cost-effective pr=\nices, which is good news for consumers and shippers of natural gas.\""      S=\nRP's associate general manager of power, construction & engineering, David =\nAreghini, concurred.  \""As we continue to diversify our fuel sources by addi=\nng new gas-fired power plants, it is important that we increase our ability=\n to obtain the necessary amount of natural gas supplies.  The Desert Crossi=\nng project will help ensure an economical and clean energy source for consu=\nmers and others in the Southwest for many years.\""     \""The additional natur=\nal gas supplies will help balance the region's escalating energy demands, e=\nspecially those of electric generators, as well as provide the potential to=\n help reduce future price spikes in the Southwest,\"" said Dwain Boettcher, v=\nice president of planning and analysis for Sempra Energy Resources. \""The ho=\nurly scheduling flexibility built into the proposed tariff was designed to =\ntransform the way storage service is offered in the future.\""     Customers =\nparticipating in the Open Season and awarded capacity will have unprecedent=\ned flexibility with respect to gaining access to the markets and diverse ga=\ns supplies in the Southwest.  These customers will be able to optimize thei=\nr portfolios, because Desert Crossing will be situated at the Southwest's e=\nnergy crossroads.     The project is subject to obtaining all necessary reg=\nulatory approvals and sufficient commitments from third parties during the =\nOpen Season.

I can't recall\nexperiencing such generosity. We are going to be able to give them more\nthan they requested. Plus, several people are already on the list to go\ndown with the next work crew and one person is going to help arrange\ngetting medical supplies to the clinic. Wow! Thanks.\n\n   The material I offered focused on how our Western approach to \""the\ntruth\"" and how modernity have had destructive effects on our religious\nand spiritual well being. We have become \""fact fundamentalists.\"" I also\ndeal with the perplexing question of what Jesus might do in dealing\nwith terrorism. The lesson ends with a telling of an ancient story from\nEthiopia about the battle between Truth and Falsehood.\n\n   What follows is a full text of the presentation.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nIs The Story You're Telling With Your Life the Truth?\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n   A boat docked in a tiny Mexican village. An American tourist\ncomplimented the Mexican fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked\nhow long it took him to catch them.\n\n   \""Not very long,\"" answered the Mexican.\n\n   \""But then, why didn't you stay out longer and catch more?\"" asked the\nAmerican.\n\n   The Mexican explained that his small catch was sufficient to meet\nhis needs and those of his family.\n\n   The American asked, \""But what do you do with the rest of your time?\""\n\n   \""I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, and take a\nsiesta with my wife. In the evenings, I go into the village to see my\nfriends, have a few drinks, play the guitar, and sing a few songs. I\nhave a full life.\""\n\n   The American interrupted, \""I have an MBA from Harvard and I can help\nyou!\n\n   \""You should start by fishing longer every day. You can then sell the\nextra fish you catch. With the extra revenue, you can buy a bigger\nboat. With the extra money the larger boat will bring, you can buy a\nsecond one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of\ntrawlers.\n\n   \""Instead of selling your fish to a middleman, you can negotiate\ndirectly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant.\nYou can then leave this little village and move to Mexico City, Los\nAngeles, or even New York City! From there you can direct your huge\nenterprise.\""\n\n   \""How long would that take?\"" asked the Mexican.\n\n   \""Twenty, perhaps twenty-five years,\"" replied the American.\n\n   \""And after that?\""\n\n   \""Afterwards? That's when it gets really interesting,\"" answered the\nAmerican, laughing. \""When your business gets really big, you can start\nselling stocks and make millions!\""\n\n   \""Millions? Really? And after that?\""\n\n   \""After that you'll be able to retire, live in a tiny village near\nthe coast, sleep late, play with your children, catch a few fish, take\na siesta, and spend your evenings drinking and enjoying your friends!\""\n\n   Ordinary Life auditor Wayne Herbert sent me that and it is just a\nwonderful story about the kinds of things I want us to be about.\n\n   I sometimes refer to what wants to happen in here with the phrase\n\""Journey Into Wholeness.\"" It is so easy for those of us in the West to\nthink that that journey is out there somewhere, in the outer world. The\ngoal of spiritual work is to become a \""self.\"" Or, to become aware of\nthe Self. I can't adequately explain to you what this self is. It is\nthe center and, at the same time, the circumference of the personality.\nIt embraces both consciousness and unconsciousness. The Self is known\nas the Christ in Christianity.\n\n   Journey into Wholeness. The root meaning of the word \""holiness\"" is\nthis wholeness. Wholeness involves finding the missing parts or the\nfaculties that are lacking in our natures and restoring them to a\ndignified place in our personality. Usually for those of us in the\nWestern world our need, as reflected in the story of the Mexican\nfisherman, is relatedness; relatedness to ourselves as well as to\nothers. This is the principle of equality I've spoken to you about so\noften. We who speak English are limited to one word for \""love.\"" In\nSanskrit there are ninety-six words for love. We are highly specialized\nin technology yet quite primitive in terms of feelings.\n\n   Jesus, and other Eastern spiritual teachers, saw the outer world to\nbe of little importance. The place where the kingdom of God was was\ninside and among us. For us, however, reality is in the outer,\nmaterial, physical world. One of the ways this has affected Christian\ntheology is the emphasis on a belief that we are so unique, so\ndistinctive that even our bodies persist on the other side of death.\nThe religion out of which we came, Judaism, thought that after death\nwhat happened to us was much like what happens to a dewdrop after the\nsunrise. Yes, it has individuality while it exists as a separate\nentity, but it is destined quite quickly to flow back into the great\nprimal ocean of existence and to lose all individuality. Does a drop of\nwater cease to exist when it falls back into the sea? Well, yes and no.\nNothing is lost but its individuality is no more. Jesus knew that the\nego was a great troublemaker for us.\n\n   We cling to everything that we think defines us as individuals. To\nthreaten this notion of who we are is hell. We protect what we call our\nindividuality at all costs. Death is bearable only if we are guaranteed\na life after death containing all the characteristics of our individual\nhuman life.\n\n   You can see how this would affect the way we go about living our\nlives and making choices about who we are and what are we to do. Those\nwere the questions that shaped, by the way, what became our Bible.\nAfter every great cultural upheaval the community of people raised the\nquestions: Who are we and what are we to do?\n\n   e.e. cummings once wrote, \""To be yourself in a world that is doing\nits best to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle\nany human being can fight, and never stop fighting.\""\n\n   I love the story of the Pentecostal man who wandered into, let us\nsay, a Methodist church. During the sermon, the visitor got so excited\nthat whenever the preacher made a point, the Pentecostal man would\nscream out, \""Praise God!\"" or \""Hallelujah!\"" or \""Amen!\"" The ushers were\nso distraught about the Pentecostal's behavior that the head usher went\ndown the aisle and whispered to him: \""You'll have to keep quiet? The\npastor's right in the middle of the sermon!\"" The Pentecostal man said,\n\""Keep quiet? How can I keep quiet? I've got the Holy Spirit!\"" To which\nthe usher said, \""Well, you didn't get it in this church!\""\n\n   The Pentecostal man made a theological error that many of us make.\nYou see, he didn't have the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit had him! And\nthat's the problem with much of our theology. We wish he had the Holy\nSpirit. There's a part of us that wishes we could keep the Holy Spirit\nin the nice, neat, tidy confines of our categories and barriers. We'd\nlike to put God in a box.\n\n   Get this: Nobody has the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit always has us\nand, given our Western orientation, that scares us so that we resist\nand repress and deny until we are spiritual dead as doornails. We want\na God in a box like we want everything else in our lives predictable\nand controllable. We want a religion that is safe. A journey that is\npredictable. There is no true spiritual journey that is that way.\n\n   We modern people have been victimized by own modernity. Of course,\nwe've benefited - we have the sciences, technology, modern medicine,\neven emphases on human rights come from our modern approach to things.\nBut it has had two deeply destructive effects on our religious and\nspiritual life.\n\n   For one thing it has made people skeptical about spiritual reality.\nIf God can't be proved by modern means, then God must not be.\n\n   Second, modernity has led us to be preoccupied with factuality -\nwith scientifically verifiable and historically reliable facts. Modern\nWestern culture is the only culture in human history that has\nidentified truth with factuality. We are, as Marcus Borg calls us,\n\""fact fundamentalists.\"" If a statement isn't scientifically or\nhistorically factual, it isn't true. These two things are serious\nmistakes and deadly to the journey inward.\n\n   Let me point out that both liberals and conservatives can be fact\nfundamentalists. Liberals try to rescue a few facts from the fire.\nConservatives say the Bible must be factually true in order to be true\nat all. This is why they emphasize the literal and historical\nfactuality of biblical texts. They both agree - facts are what matters.\n\n   If I had a magic wand that worked, one of the things I would do is\nto get both liberals and conservatives alike to see how modern both of\nthese positions are.\n\n   What we've got when it comes to having faith today for most people\nis whether they can believe \""iffy\"" things or not. That, to most people,\nis what Christianity has become. It is as if what God wants most from\nus is believing highly problematic statements to be factually true.\nAnd, if you can't believe them, then you don't \""have faith\"" and\nprobably aren't a Christian.\n\n   Listen carefully: Faith has to do with your relation to God, to\nSelf. Not whether you believe the Bible to be true or not.\n\n   I'm going to come back to this in the weeks ahead.\n\n   Let me see if I can give you an example. One of the questions that\nhas persistently come up in the discussion group has to do with what\nJesus' view on violence might be. This has been raised since the events\nof 9/11. What would Jesus have us do? Does professing to be Christian\nmean trying to live as Christ might live? And if so, why aren't we\ndoing what he asks us to do?\n\n   First of all, I confess I have not a clue what Jesus would do in\nresponse to 9/11. My hunch is not much. His interest was not in that\nsort of thing. Besides, he had little political power.\n\n   If we went to him and asked, I think he would probably tell a story.\nHe might tell the story of the Good Iranian Terrorist. That's what the\nparable of the Good Samaritan sounded like to the people of his time.\n\n   \""Who are you he might ask?\"" Then tell a story to us as we stand\nthere with our mouths open and scratching our heads.\n\n   Maybe he would tell a story like this:\n\n   One day a rabbi, in a frenzy of religious passion, rushed in before\nthe ark, fell to his knees, and started beating his breast, crying,\n\""I'm nobody! I'm nobody!\"" The cantor of the synagogue, impressed by\nthis example of spiritual humility, joined the rabbi on his knees. \""I'm\nnobody!  I'm nobody!\"" The custodian, watching from the corner, couldn't\nrestrain himself, either. He joined the other two on his knees, calling\nout, \""I'm nobody! I'm nobody!\"" At which point the rabbi, nudging the\ncantor with his elbow, pointed at the custodian and said, \""Look who\nthinks he's nobody!\""\n\n   I'll tell you something that might be misunderstood. I think that\none of the numbers that organized religion has done on us is to\nconvince us that we are supposed to be like Jesus. What God is\ninterested in is saving human beings. That being the case what we must\ndo is be human. The Christian conspiracy, I'm going to call it, against\nbeing human is to convince us that what we are supposed to do is be\nlike Jesus.\n\n   A couple of years ago there was a popular slogan: WWJD. The goal was\nto ask before doing any and everything, \""What would Jesus do?\""\n\n   If Jesus were here today, would he have worked for Enron? Would he\nhave been on the board of directors? If Jesus were here today, would he\ngo to church? Which one? The image that I had of Jesus when I grew up\nwas that Jesus would not go to movies on Sunday but he would go\nswimming because we had a lot of water in our town. Would he be a\nRepublican or a Democrat? Would he be involved in the political\nprocess?\n\n   The one thing that Jesus Christ was about was love and he did this\nby the extravagant way that he lived his life. He wasn't married; he\ndidn't hold down a job; he didn't have to raise kids. The Roman church\nhas it that Jesus was such a guy that not only did he not have a sexual\ndimension, neither did his mother.\n\n   What Jesus was about - and still is - is Love. The extravagant way\nthat Jesus lived his life was to communicate the overwhelming love that\nGod has for us. Boundless love. Inexpressible love. It is like God\ncomes down and puts arms around us and says, \""This is how much I love\nyou. Now love yourself like that.\"" This was the thing that marked the\nministry of Jesus. So Soren Kierkegaard writes, \""To will to be that\nself which one truly is, is the opposite of despair.\""\n\n   How do you do that? Well, to be the self you truly are is to have a\nparticular history and it is to aspire to go beyond the limitations of\nthat history and it is to be frustrated when you realize you can't. To\naccept this humanness means to be passionate about our aspirations and\ncompassionate about our limitations. It is like you get up from where\nyou're sitting and come up here and stand beside me physically and look\nat the person who is seated in the chair where you are and you have\ncompassion for that person. It is that kind of acceptance.\n\n   We are not to be like Jesus. We are to be Christ-like. There is a\nworld of difference.\n\n   Jesus went around kicking self-esteem into people. All of the\nstories that you find in the New Testament are like that. Look at the\nstories of his ministry. If a man can restore sight to a blind man, he\ngives that person a new lease on life, a new self-confidence. If a man\ncan absolve a prostitute's guilt in lasting forgiveness, he gives her\nthe gift of self-respect. The crippled, the insane, the leper, the tax\ncollector, the beggar - a motley assortment of humanity desperately in\nneed of self-esteem and he extended it to them.\n\n   The same dynamic was at work even when he was chasing the\nmoneychangers out of the temple. It may be temporarily embarrassing to\nbe kicked out of your accustomed place of business, but it has been\nknown to lead to self-respect. The message is: You're made for\nsomething better than this. You are loved by God. This self-compassion\nis foundational for the abundant life and I'm sure that the response\nJesus would have us make to the terrorist situation as well as the rest\nof life is this kind of love.\n\n   He would tell a story. One of his central teachings was: You shall\nknow the Truth and the Truth shall set you free. (But first it's going\nto mess with your life and upset you!) So, let me tell you a story\nabout Truth to ponder. This story is from the Ethiopian culture.\n\n   Long ago, Fire, Water, Truth, and Falsehood lived together in one\nlarge house. Although all were polite toward each other, they kept\ntheir distance. Truth and Falsehood sat on opposite sides of the room.\nFire constantly leapt out of Water's path.\n\n   One day they went hunting together. They found a large number of\ncattle and began driving them home to their village. \""Let us share\nthese cattle equally,\"" said Truth as they traveled across the\ngrasslands. \""This is the fair way to divine our captives.\""\n\n   No one disagreed with Truth except Falsehood. Falsehood wanted more\nthan an equal share but kept quiet about it for the moment. As the four\nhunters traveled back to the Village, Falsehood went secretly to Water\nand whispered, \""You are more powerful than Fire. Destroy Fire and then\nthere will be more cattle for each of us!\""\n\n   Water flowed over Fire, bubbling and steaming until Fire was gone.\nWater meandered along, cheerfully thinking about more cattle for\nitself.\n\n   Falsehood, meanwhile, whispered to Truth. \""Look! See for yourself!\nWater has killed Fire! Let us leave Water, who has cruelly destroyed\nour warmhearted friend. We must take the cattle high in the mountains\nto graze.\""\n\n   As Truth and Falsehood traveled up the mountain, Water tried to\nfollow. But the mountain was too steep; And Water could not flow\nupwards. Water washed down upon itself, splashing and swirling around\nrocks as it tumbled down the slope. Look and see! Water is still\ntumbling down the mountainside to this day.\n\n   Truth and Falsehood arrived at the mountaintop. Falsehood turned to\nTruth and said in a loud voice, \""I am more powerful than you! You will\nbe my servant. I am your master. All the cattle belong to me!\""\n\n   Truth rose up and spoke out, \""I will not be your servant!\""\n\n   They battled and battled. Finally they brought the argument to Wind\nto decide who was the master.\n\n   Wind didn't know. Wind blew all over the world to ask people whether\nTruth or Falsehood was more powerful. Some people said, \""A single word\nof Falsehood can completely destroy Truth.\"" Others insisted, \""Like a\nsmall candle in the dark, Truth can change every situation.\""\n\n   Wind finally returned to the mountain and said, \""I have seen that\nFalsehood is very powerful. But it can rule only where Truth has\nstopped struggling to be heard.\""\n\n   And it has been that way ever since.\n\n   I think what Jesus would do if we asked him what we are to do is\nthat he would likely tell a story. And then he would remind us that we\nourselves are telling a story with our lives. After saying that,\nperhaps he would ask, \""Is the story you are telling with your life the\ntruth?\""\n\n   No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember\nthis: You are carrying precious cargo.

APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  \n\nAs to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (\""RECs\""), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. \n\nTrading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.  Doug Gilbert-Smith this afternoon identified the following counterparties in decreasing order of of their priority as trading partners in ERCOT:  \n\nTXU Energy Trading \nBP Energy Company\nReliant Energy Services, Inc.\nAquila Power Corporation\nMorgan Stanley capitral Group\nConstellation Power Source\nFPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc.\nAmerican Electic Power Service Corporation\nMirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP\nCalpine Energy Servicces LP\nDynegy Marketing & Trade\nLCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority\n\nalong with a couple of incumbent utilities:\n\nSan Antonio City Public Service\nReliant HL&P\n\nIf you desire Doug Gilbert -Smith to sit in on this meeting, then it would have to be scheduled for Thursday.\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tSteffes, James D.  \nSent:\tWednesday, January 30, 2002 8:41 AM\nTo:\tGilbert-smith, Doug; Day, Smith L.; Sager, Elizabeth; Portz, David\nCc:\tWill, Lloyd; Presto, Kevin M.; Bailey, Debra; Haedicke, Mark E.\nSubject:\tUBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs\n\nUBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.

Before I turn to the organizational=\n changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t=\nhe company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are b=\ny their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of t=\nhis group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had =\nthat responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re=\nsponsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven=\n by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat=\ned group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also =\nvery decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is =\nnot easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor=\nk, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we =\nshared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=\n have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=\n are leaving for all you have done.\n\nAs to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =\nme that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=\nctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =\nability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee=\nd to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all =\nU.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, =\nJim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j=\nointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of =\nthe group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h=\nelp Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=\ndership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=\nty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =\nbe led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La=\nst, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o=\nn California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part=\n of the Wholesale electricity team).\n\nSteve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =\ndevelopment effort along with Dan Allegretti.\n\nWith the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=\n a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=\nislative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=\nill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=\n will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=\nelopment efforts across the U.S.\n\nMuch of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti=\nnue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, =\ntaking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi=\nm will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con=\ntinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.

APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  \n\nAs to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (\""RECs\""), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. \n\nTrading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.

I pointed out the Section 542 of the bankruptcy code requires them to turn over property of the estate and our position is they don't have a valid lien.  I also indicated they were opening themselves up to damages for violation of the bankrupcty stay.  John indicated that since this issue (whether Article 7 of the UCC applies to natural gas storage)  would be a case of first impression they would be willing to litigate considering the amounts involved.  Summary - They are not willing to release the gas.  They are willing to release gas in excess of the amounts we owe to them, but only if stipulated that they are not waving their rights to assert the warehouseman's lien.  At this point it is probably better to get some gas and then decide whether to litigate the remainder.  Thoughts?  Stuart,  the answers to your questions are inserted below.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tZisman, Stuart  \nSent:\tFriday, January 11, 2002 11:02 AM\nTo:\tNemec, Gerald\nCc:\tRedmond, Brian; Parks, Joe\nSubject:\tBridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails\n\nI think we need to crystallize, in very short order, what the approval process will be for the sale of the Pad Gas in Storage Caverns #13/#14 to Bridgeline.  I will send you via fax the proposed deal sheet.\n\nSeveral interesting points from the meeting:\n\n1)  Bridgeline is of the view that 3/12/2002 (we thought it was 4/402) is the last day on which they are obligated to reimburse Enron for the Dow Lease - Any thoughts?  Who is right?; The contract states that they are obligated to reimburse through the earlier of July 1, 2002 or 114 days following the 4 BCF Date.  The 4 BCF date is defined at the day of the last Enron Pad Gas Payment.  The last Pad Gas Payment (for the month of November) was due on 12/10/01.  Thus, the 114 days should run from 12/10/01, which puts right around 4/4/02. \n\n2)  Their plan (assuming our deal goes through) is to amend and assume the existing lease - and get Dow to expressly release LRCI from any and all claims/liabilities/etc. following Bridgeline's assumption of the amended lease; This approach sounds reasonable. \n\n3)  Bridgeline indicated that Dow is of the opinion that approximately $167k is owed by Enron for dewatering brine removal fees ($0.20 per ton of salt removed) - I need your help to determine whether this is accurate; I don't see any basis for this in the agreement.  The $0.20 per ton of salt removed fee, refers to barrels of capacity being created in the Cavern #1.  This is related to the leaching operation.  If the fee is related to the leaching operation, then they might be correct. (Accounting would need to verify their numbers though).  If they are seeking a fee for brine removal during degassing, I don't think they have a basis for this fee.  We need to understand their basis for the claim.  \n\n4)  Bridgeline is desirous of having Cavern #1 (along with the various rights-of-way) conveyed sooner rather than later (and wondered whether we could expedite the approval process on this part of the deal).  I don't know what the advantages/disadvantages there are to this but would love your input along with your thoughts on whether this is feasible or not; We have until July 1, 2002 to convey the Cavern #1.  To the extent we wanted to wait to wrap up all our issues and convey at that time, we are not harmed under the Partnership agreement.  Obviously we retain any risks associated with ownership of the cavern. \n\n5)  We indicated that we thought the approval process would take approximately 30 days from the day that we reached what we believed were mutually agreeable terms with Bridgeline (does this sound right?) - The goal is to be done no later than March 1, 2002; and I think this sounds reasonable. \n\n6)  Eric Booth is going to call Robert Morgan to get the support for the $550k of expenses relating to the dewatering line and the flowline.\n\nStuart"", ""Kelley,\n\nI am writing to you to follow up on our discussion last week regarding disclosure of counterparty names for price verification purposes.\nCan you give me the name and contact information for the person within your company that would work with us to put a Confidentiality Agreement in place.\nJeff Hodge is our lawyer who will work on this for Enron.

This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven=\n by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat=\ned group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also =\nvery decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is =\nnot easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor=\nk, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we =\nshared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=\n have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=\n are leaving for all you have done.\n\nAs to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =\nme that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=\nctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =\nability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee=\nd to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all =\nU.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.

(Sue Mara will also be part=\n of the Wholesale electricity team).\n\nSteve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =\ndevelopment effort along with Dan Allegretti.\n\nWith the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=\n a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=\nislative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=\nill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=\n will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=\nelopment efforts across the U.S.\n\nMuch of the rest of the group remains the same.

There are a few, however, that may be incorrectly categorized, as follows:\n \nEA:             ECT Non U.S. Payroll Company (there is no such entity, but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA)\n                   Enron Capital & Trade Resources in London, UK  (may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited)\n \nEBS:           Broadband Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (actually comes up to Corp. through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance)\n \nEEOS:        Enron Engineering & Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp.\n                   The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd. whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe.  \n \nEES:           Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity\n                    The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities Services/Limbach companies\n \nEGA:         Here's where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with \n                 complicated, multi-layers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp. ownership.  As you know all of the old subsets (i.e. APACHI, CALME, etc.) have\n                 gone away and everything international is now EGA.    To the best of our knowledge, all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed.\n                 Following are the exceptions and/or unusual organizational structure that should be noted:\n                    Electricidad Enron de Guatemala S.A. actually reports up through ENA\n                    San Juan Gas Company, Inc. in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp. (100% owned)\n                    Enron American del Sur, S.A.  is an Enron Corp./Enron Transportation Services entity\n                    No entity called Enron Singapore .... more than likely Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company.\n \nEIM:         No Stadacona Paper Company but it  is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM \n                Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp. as the general partner and a list of Limited\n                Partners including ENA, Enron Corp. and a non-Enron entity (Salomon Brothers Holding Company, Inc.)\n \nENW:        Enron Net Works, LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp. company\n \nEWC:        The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp. which is owned by Smith Street Land Co., an Enron Corp. company, but many of the \n                 names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list.   For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas, S.A.; \n                 no Enron Wind UK, no Enron Wind India .... but regardless, they are all part of the EWC/EREC family.\n \nGLOBAL    These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration & Production, Inc., which is owned by Enron Corp., but one has indirect outside ownership.\n EP:           Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd., for instance, is owned by Enron Asst Holdings, which is owned by Enron Finance Partners, which is part of a complex ownership\n                 structure that includes one non-Enron entity (Zephyrus Investments, LLC) with a small interest.      \n                    \nAgain, I hope this information is helpful.

We expect Congress to be in session until late November or even into December. \n\nThe PTC extension was passed out of the House in its energy package (it was part of the tax title).  The Senate Committee is expected to consider its version of the energy in September into October.  We expect the PTC to pass in the Senate as well.\n\nNow to the timing, it is unclear if the energy package (with the PTC extension)will move before Congress adjourns for the year.  If it does not, then Congress can pass what it calls an \""extenders package\"" which would extend all tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year.  If that were to not happen, then Congress could send notice to the Administration that it plans to pass the PTC and other extenders early next year and make it retroactive until December 31, 2001.  Any of theses scenarios is possible.\n\nWhile nothing is 100% when you deal with Congress, I think it highly likely the PTC will be extended either this year or retroactively next.  The question then becomes for how long.  The House bill extends it for five years and we are pushing for longer in the Senate.  I do not think a permanent extension is possible given the revenue numbers.\n\nLet me know if you need additional information.\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Walia, Amit \nSent: Wednesday, August 22, 2001 10:51 AM\nTo: Long, Chris\nCc: Metts, Mark\nSubject: Wind Production Tax Credit (PTC)\n\n\nChris,\n\nWe wanted to get an update on what was happending with the PTC in Washington.

The PTC will be extended.   There is significant bipartisan support for the PTC, the revenue number is reasonable, and renewables are a key component of the energy debate.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe question is when and how.  Two likely scenarios are:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1)  As part of the Energy Bill.  The House Ways and Means Committee will mark-up the tax portions of the energy bill in mid-July.  We understand that Chairman Thomas is committed to including the PTC as part of the Ways and Means bill.  The Senate Finance Committee has not scheduled a mark-up.  While the energy bill will be debated during July, final action will likely not occur until after the August recess.   In this scenario, look to September at the earliest.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2)  There are 10 provisions, including the PTC,  in the IRC that expire by December 31, 2001.   Historically, Congress approves an \""extenders\"" package late in the session to keep the tax credits functioning.   While no one can predict when Congress will adjourn, they are set to adjourn in early October.

There are a few, however, that may be incorrectly categorized, as follows:\n \nEA:             ECT Non U.S. Payroll Company (there is no such entity, but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA)\n                   Enron Capital & Trade Resources in London, UK  (may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited)\n \nEBS:           Broadband Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (actually comes up to Corp. through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance)\n \nEEOS:        Enron Engineering & Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp.\n                   The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd. whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe.  \n \nEES:           Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity\n                    The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities Services/Limbach companies\n \nEGA:         Here's where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with \n                 complicated, multi-layers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp. ownership.  As you know all of the old subsets (i.e. APACHI, CALME, etc.) have\n                 gone away and everything international is now EGA.    To the best of our knowledge, all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed.\n                 Following are the exceptions and/or unusual organizational structure that should be noted:\n                    Electricidad Enron de Guatemala S.A. actually reports up through ENA\n                    San Juan Gas Company, Inc. in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp. (100% owned)\n                    Enron American del Sur, S.A.  is an Enron Corp./Enron Transportation Services entity\n                    No entity called Enron Singapore .... more than likely Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company.\n \nEIM:         No Stadacona Paper Company but it  is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM \n                Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp. as the general partner and a list of Limited\n                Partners including ENA, Enron Corp. and a non-Enron entity (Salomon Brothers Holding Company, Inc.)\n \nENW:        Enron Net Works, LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp. company\n \nEWC:        The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp. which is owned by Smith Street Land Co., an Enron Corp. company, but many of the \n                 names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list.   For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas, S.A.; \n                 no Enron Wind UK, no Enron Wind India .... but regardless, they are all part of the EWC/EREC family.\n \nGLOBAL    These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration & Production, Inc., which is owned by Enron Corp., but one has indirect outside ownership.\n EP:           Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd., for instance, is owned by Enron Asst Holdings, which is owned by Enron Finance Partners, which is part of a complex ownership\n                 structure that includes one non-Enron entity (Zephyrus Investments, LLC) with a small interest.      \n                    \nAgain, I hope this information is helpful.  For the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track.

We were told that star performers will be retained.  At what profit level do we become star performers?\n\nI understand you and your staff have a tremendous number of things that need to be accomplished.  As I talk with my peers, the most important thing on our minds is if we will have a job and what we will be paid.  John was saying that in a few months this issue would be addressed.  My immediate concern is to secure employment while there are still positions available with other companies.  I will accept the first lucrative offer that is made to me.  My peers have expressed the same sentiment.  In a few months, there may not be any jobs left.   We have to may hay while the sun shines.  We all have been bombarded with calls from executive search firms.  We are all racing for a limited number of jobs that promise substantially higher salaries.\n\nWhat we need on this floor is some assurances.  Maybe it should be in the form of granting bonuses now and offering employment contracts.  We need some exact numbers in the form of dates, salaries, and bonus plans. \n\nScott Neal brought up this same question several times and John said he understood how critical this situation is.  If there are only trader track personnel left to run this company, will Dynegy still be interested?\n\nGetting a bonus this year that reflects the work I put in is critical.  It is no where near as critical the issue of making sure my children have food on the table.  I do not have two months to wait to find out that the compensation I will be offered ends up being less than what a third party is willing to pay, or the bonus program is a based on a amount to appease me when I may have passed up a percentage deal.\n\nPlease sense the urgency that my peers and I are feeling.\n\nTom Donohoe "", ""Ok on Sachs\n\nI think that's a real problem with their money - how much each and how are the people?

Before I turn to the organizational=\n changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t=\nhe company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are b=\ny their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of t=\nhis group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had =\nthat responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re=\nsponsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven=\n by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat=\ned group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also =\nvery decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is =\nnot easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor=\nk, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we =\nshared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=\n have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=\n are leaving for all you have done.\n\nAs to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =\nme that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=\nctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =\nability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee=\nd to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all =\nU.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, =\nJim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j=\nointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of =\nthe group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h=\nelp Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=\ndership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=\nty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =\nbe led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La=\nst, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o=\nn California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part=\n of the Wholesale electricity team).\n\nSteve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =\ndevelopment effort along with Dan Allegretti.\n\nWith the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=\n a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=\nislative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=\nill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=\n will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=\nelopment efforts across the U.S.\n\nMuch of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti=\nnue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, =\ntaking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi=\nm will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con=\ntinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over su=\npport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market=\ns, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue=\n to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government=\n affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout=\nh America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts=\n, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.\n\nI am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs =\nto provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Comm=\nittee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman,=\n Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord=\n, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also con=\ntinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry King=\nerski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am form=\ning a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of =\nJose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself=\n.\n\nNo organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf=\nect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more pre=\npared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as th=\ne future unfolds for the company.\n\nOne final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through =\nthis uncertain and troubled period for the company.  We are all saddened by=\n the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr=\noup fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each othe=\nr and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, f=\nor those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excelle=\nnce and integrity that has characterized our group.  Personally, I will do =\nall I can, for as long as I can, to steer the group through this to the ver=\ny best place possible.  Your continued dedication and support is very much =\nappreciated.

There are a few, however, that may be incorrectly categorized, as follows:\n \nEA:             ECT Non U.S. Payroll Company (there is no such entity, but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA)\n                   Enron Capital & Trade Resources in London, UK  (may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited)\n \nEBS:           Broadband Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (actually comes up to Corp. through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance)\n \nEEOS:        Enron Engineering & Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp.\n                   The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd. whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe.  \n \nEES:           Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity\n                    The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities Services/Limbach companies\n \nEGA:         Here's where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with \n                 complicated, multi-layers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp. ownership.  As you know all of the old subsets (i.e. APACHI, CALME, etc.) have\n                 gone away and everything international is now EGA.    To the best of our knowledge, all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed.\n                 Following are the exceptions and/or unusual organizational structure that should be noted:\n                    Electricidad Enron de Guatemala S.A. actually reports up through ENA\n                    San Juan Gas Company, Inc. in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp. (100% owned)\n                    Enron American del Sur, S.A.  is an Enron Corp./Enron Transportation Services entity\n                    No entity called Enron Singapore .... more than likely Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company.\n \nEIM:         No Stadacona Paper Company but it  is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM \n                Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp. as the general partner and a list of Limited\n                Partners including ENA, Enron Corp. and a non-Enron entity (Salomon Brothers Holding Company, Inc.)\n \nENW:        Enron Net Works, LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp. company\n \nEWC:        The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp. which is owned by Smith Street Land Co., an Enron Corp. company, but many of the \n                 names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list.   For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas, S.A.; \n                 no Enron Wind UK, no Enron Wind India .... but regardless, they are all part of the EWC/EREC family.\n \nGLOBAL    These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration & Production, Inc., which is owned by Enron Corp., but one has indirect outside ownership.\n EP:           Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd., for instance, is owned by Enron Asst Holdings, which is owned by Enron Finance Partners, which is part of a complex ownership\n                 structure that includes one non-Enron entity (Zephyrus Investments, LLC) with a small interest.      \n                    \nAgain, I hope this information is helpful.

Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.\n\nThe kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.\n\nWe continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.\n\n\nIn summary, Heidi's performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.

He picked up a large empty\nmayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks.  He then asked the\nstudents if the jar was full?  They agreed that it was. The professor\npicked up a box of  sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand\nfilled up everything else. \""Now,\"" said the professor, \""I want you to\nrecognize that this is your life.\n\n\""The rocks are the important things - your family, your partner, your\nhealth, your children - things that if everything else was lost and only\nthey  remained, your life would still be full. The sand is everything else.\nThe small stuff.\n\n\""If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no room  for the rocks.\nThe same goes for your life. If you spend all your  time and energy on the\nsmall stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to\nyou.\""\n\nBut then a student took the jar which the other students and the professor\nagreed was full, and  proceeded to pour in a can of beer. Of course the\nbeer filled the  remaining spaces within the jar making the jar truly full.\n\n\nThe moral of this tale is: That no matter how full your life is,  there is\nalways room for BEER.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"", ""\nDid he ever have any taste?\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Murphy, Tim [mailto:Tim.Murphy@ElPaso.com]\nSent: Tuesday, December 04, 2001 8:38 AM\nTo: 'Bump, Dan'; 'Whitt, Mark'\nSubject: FW: Three Choices\n\n\nIt seems Mr. Lattin has little taste.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Lattin, John \nSent: Monday, December 03, 2001 4:02 PM\nTo: Murphy, Tim\nSubject: FW: Three Choices\n\n\n\n>\n> Three Choices\n>\n> A guy tells his wife that she has three choices.

APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  \n\nAs to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (\""RECs\""), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. \n\nTrading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.

APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  \n\nAs to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (\""RECs\""), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. \n\nTrading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.

APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  \n\nAs to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (\""RECs\""), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. \n\nTrading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.

In preparation for the meeting we need to have information regarding the pipe:\n\n1)\tWe need the operational capabilities of the pipe.   This should include major receipt points, delivery points, through put capability, line pack balances, and storage facilities (both owned by the pipeline as well as third parties).

Prior to the move, we had a very efficient, open configuration that let us work together as a unified team.  \n\nAfter the move, we are located on 3 different floors.   Besides the general impact on team unity, this move also means that our evening staff work alone on separate floors, rather than in a group.  It means fewer individuals to cover customer calls.  It means having more equipment to cover the day to day business.   I have worked hard to calm the team that this arrangement is just temporary and that we will eventually be put back together as a team.\n\nPrior to our move I constantly questioned whether our move was necessary.

Foothills agreed to reflect the suggested changes to the model (An=\ndy is supposed to send out a summary of the discussion) and provided an ele=\nctronic copy of the model for withdrawn partners' review. Withdrawn partner=\ns agreed to give their comments/feedback on the model to Foothills until 11=\n/27/01 and another meeting to reach an agreement on economic model/toll was=\n scheduled for 12/03/01 or 12/04/01. The data from economic/toll model will=\n be used in commercial proposal/presentation to the ANS producers which ANN=\nGTC intends to have by 12/20/01. Tim and I will review Foothills' cash flow=\n and COS model and prepare comments.\n\nOverall, the participants though that the current Foothills model ($0.43/MM=\nBtu toll for Alaska section) has very aggressive assumptions in many ways, =\nand it is very likely that the toll will be increased significantly after a=\nll the appropriate revisions are made. The following are the main discussio=\nn points of the meeting. Item 1 and 2 are expected to have a very large imp=\nact on the toll.\n\n1) Capex and Opex need to have annual/monthly escalation (current model has=\n 0% escalation). For example, Foothills sensitivity analysis shows that 2.5=\n% Capex escalation would increase the toll by $0.20. Numbers such as 1.5% f=\nor Capex and 2.5% for Opex were thrown during the meeting, but more reviews=\n need to be done regarding appropriate escalation rates. Do you have any op=\ninion on this, Bryan?\n\n2) Foothills is using Flowthrough method (using cash taxes in COS calculati=\non) to calculate income taxes that go into the Cost of Service and might be=\n underestimating Cost of Service. Tim thought that the Flowthrough method w=\nill not fly because of previous cases in which that method was not allowed =\nby IRS and FERC. Foothills said that they can still have same toll under No=\nrmalized tax method by changing the depreciation number, but Tim was concer=\nned that it might force the partnership to record negative depreciation. Fo=\nothills declined our request to share their Cost of Service model and insis=\nted that we calculate the toll ourselves based on the information in the ca=\nsh flow model. They agreed to provide a hard copy of their Cost of Service =\nmodel in the end, but Tim and I were under impression that Foothills was tr=\nying to lower the toll as much as they can. Tim was also concerned about le=\nvelized toll approach because of FERC might lower allowed return in the lat=\ner rate cases and more analysis needs to done regradign this. Please correc=\nt me if I am wrong here, Tim.\n\n3) OM & A is currently estimated to be 1% of Capex but this might be too lo=\nw (OM&A in more latest cost estimate by Foothills is approx. 1.5% of total =\nCapex).\n\n4) The Withdrawn Partners' historical contributions ($228 million) will be =\nadded to the Rate Base, but this might be dropped if necessary. Success fee=\n of $40 million should be included in the project budget.\n\n5) Working Capital will be added to the project cost. The Line Pack cost (1=\n4.5 Bcf for the whole section) was assumed to be borne by ANS producers but=\n some participants highly doubted that that would be the case. The Line Pac=\nk gas might have to be bought by the Partnership or the Producers will at l=\neast demand certain return on their gas sitting in the pipeline for 25 year=\ns.\n\n6) For Return on Capital and AFUDC, 14% ROE and 8% Interest on Debt assumin=\ng 30/70 capital structure is likely to be kept. However, the current drawdo=\nwn schedule assumes construction financing available from the very beginnin=\ng, which will not be true. Certain assumptions should be made on the financ=\nial close date and commercial agreement/preliminary determination date to c=\nalculate AFUDC more accurately.\n\n7) Current financing assumption in the model is a 25 year bank loan with ba=\nlloon amortization and DSCR of 1.6. In reality, the initial bank loans will=\n be of shorter maturity (5-15 years) and certain roll-over financing will b=\ne unavoidable. It is also likely that the loans will have multiple tranches=\n with different terms, interest rate, seniority etc.=20\n\n8) There is significant currency risk associated with Canadian section of t=\nhe ANGTS considering that some sources of capital, revenues and part of ope=\nrating expenses will be in Canadian dollars. A mechanis to mitigate currenc=\ny risk should be in place and there might be some costs associated with it.\n\n9) Property taxes of 2% in Alaska seems high, but Property taxes during con=\nstruction period should be added.=20\n\nLastly, there is about $300 million difference ($4,336-$4035) between ETS c=\nurrent cost estimates and the cost estimate in the Foothills model, excludi=\nng IDC and AFUDC. Another engineering estimate might have to be dome for la=\nrger pipe size (46 or 48 inch) as noted in Bryan's email. =20\n\nThanks,=20\n\nJB=20\n\nJebong Lee=20\n713-853-9722 office=20\n713-306-8658 cell"", ""Corp Security did a quick audit today of the Gas Control Center on EB42 and made several recommendations of some \nsteps we should take prior to some of the expected workforce changes next week.  \n\n1) Tighten control of access to the Gas Control facilities\n\t- They recommended reducing access to a single door and posting a guard for the next week or so.\n\t- They recommended reviewing the card access lists for the secure doors and reducing to critical staff only.\n\n\tWe have arranged for a guard beginning Monday morning.

Prior to the move, we had a very efficient, open configuration that let us work together as a unified team.  \n\nAfter the move, we are located on 3 different floors.   Besides the general impact on team unity, this move also means that our evening staff work alone on separate floors, rather than in a group.  It means fewer individuals to cover customer calls.  It means having more equipment to cover the day to day business.   I have worked hard to calm the team that this arrangement is just temporary and that we will eventually be put back together as a team.\n\nPrior to our move I constantly questioned whether our move was necessary.  I asked about smaller, more practical changes to fit more people on the floor.  And, I specifically asked about whether Enron issues might impact the groups desire to continue to spend $7-$10 million -- even as I reluctantly packed up my boxes.\n\nI hope you can appreciate that the current seating arrangement is a serious issue for my team and one that generates constant questions as my staff meetings.  Finding out  that we moved off of 41 for no reason at an all-employee floor meeting undermines my team's faith in my leadership."", ""Rod,\n    I just signed the confidentiality agreement and will track down the ENA contracts asap.

Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that\ntime, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. \n  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any\nrelated tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an \""excess\nparachute payment,\"" according to the filing. \n  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. \n  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is\nentitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment\nwithin the 60 days. \n  Houston-based Enron is a utilities and communications company. -Dan Lowrey;\nDow Jones Newswires; 202-393-7402; dan.lowrey@dowjones.com \n \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires  13-11-01\n  1428GMT(AP-DJ-11-13-01 1428GMT)\n\nSymbols:\n  US;DYN US;ENE \n\n  13-Nov-2001  14:28:54 GMT\nSource DJES   - Dow Jones Energy Service\nCategories:\n  I/ELC I/GAS I/UES I/XISL N/CNW N/DJWI N/DPG N/LNG N/NRG N/WEI M/NND M/UTI\n  P/NRG R/NAPW R/NERC R/NME R/TX R/US R/USS MST/I/ELC MST/I/GAS MST/I MST/N/LNG\n  MST/R/NME MST/R/US/TX MST/R/US "", ""     \nThere will be two presentations tomorrow from UBS commencing at 2:30 p.m. (CST).

He picked up a large empty\nmayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks.  He then asked the\nstudents if the jar was full?  They agreed that it was. The professor\npicked up a box of  sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand\nfilled up everything else. \""Now,\"" said the professor, \""I want you to\nrecognize that this is your life.\n\n\""The rocks are the important things - your family, your partner, your\nhealth, your children - things that if everything else was lost and only\nthey  remained, your life would still be full. The sand is everything else.\nThe small stuff.\n\n\""If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no room  for the rocks.\nThe same goes for your life. If you spend all your  time and energy on the\nsmall stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to\nyou.\""\n\nBut then a student took the jar which the other students and the professor\nagreed was full, and  proceeded to pour in a can of beer. Of course the\nbeer filled the  remaining spaces within the jar making the jar truly full.\n\n\nThe moral of this tale is: That no matter how full your life is,  there is\nalways room for BEER.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"", ""and how might you want to be involved???\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tLucci, Paul T.  \nSent:\tTuesday, November 06, 2001 3:41 PM\nTo:\tStaab, Theresa\nSubject:\tRE: Wyoming Interstate Gas Company (WIC) Maintenance\n\nContact me directly, I always want to be involved!\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tStaab, Theresa  \nSent:\tTuesday, November 06, 2001 3:37 PM\nTo:\tReitmeyer, Jay; 'sscott5@enron.com'; Adams, Jacqueline P.; Mendel, Shelly; Lucci, Paul T.; Felling, Amy\nSubject:\tFW: Wyoming Interstate Gas Company (WIC) Maintenance\n\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tSchlecht, Dinah  \nSent:\tTuesday, November 06, 2001 3:29 PM\nTo:\tSitter, Scott; Serrano, Walt; Fresquez, Rick; Wiederholt, Barry; Rafter, Mick\nCc:\tKim Thomas (E-mail); Staab, Theresa; Jyl Baumann (E-mail)\nSubject:\tWyoming Interstate Gas Company (WIC) Maintenance\n\nOn Tuesday, November 13, 2001, the Douglas Station will be out of service for approximately 8 hours.

APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  \n\nAs to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (\""RECs\""), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. \n\nTrading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements.

(The tabs total 184 with one Associate noted on a separate line in Power Logistics, and 183 without that Associate, so I don't know whether you are using 183 or 184 currently for the Operations total.) Taking this number to 100 in total is obviously a big change - 45.6% reduction.  At this moment, I don't know how feasible that is.  But I will work with Jeff, Stacey and Leslie to find out.\n \nWe  need some questions answered first to go through this:\n \n1)  Who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for Gas and Power Logistics?  Together, those groups represent 25% of the 184 headcount.  Going in, I would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions - should be 21 reductions.  We need to know who we should work with to coordinate this.  Need names and weekend contact numbers.\n \n2)  What will the overall headcount be for Netco?  What we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes.  If commercial numbers don't change and the business scope doesn't change, a 45.6% reduction is probably out of the question.  \n \n3)  Is the 100 number for Operations only a start-up number?  Could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up, approval is obtained for physical gas business, etc.?  Or is the 100 number intended to be the total headcount for all of 2002?\n \n4)  What are UBS' expectations for mid and back office?  What are the views from Legal and UBS on creating confirmations for EOL transactions?  There were some discussions with Leslie Reeves about not confirming certain types of transactions.  One firm, and I don't remember whether it was UBS or not, mentioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions, and that instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations.  That is a completely different activity than we normally engage in, and would make a difference in staffing - perhaps requiring more people!   We need to know those things from UBS to take a real stab at a revised number.  Should we just pool our knowledge from various discussions that have been had with UBS, or is there someone with UBS that we should be talking with this weekend to get there view of what is required?\n \n5)  Does the internal RAC group go forward under a headcount reduction - i.e. will we be coordinating and providing information to them, or will UBS assume some of their functions?  This may impact our staffing needs.  What about consolidated risk reporting - will Stacey and Jeff simply transmit data to UBS, or Netco have to provide some consolidated risk reporting before sending info to UBS?\n \nWe may have more questions, but these are key now to get at a feasible number.  \n \n--Sally \n "", ""The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.

There are a few, however, that may be incorrectly categorized, as follows:\n \nEA:             ECT Non U.S. Payroll Company (there is no such entity, but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA)\n                   Enron Capital & Trade Resources in London, UK  (may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited)\n \nEBS:           Broadband Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (actually comes up to Corp. through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance)\n \nEEOS:        Enron Engineering & Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp.\n                   The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd. whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe.  \n \nEES:           Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity\n                    The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities Services/Limbach companies\n \nEGA:         Here's where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with \n                 complicated, multi-layers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp. ownership.  As you know all of the old subsets (i.e. APACHI, CALME, etc.) have\n                 gone away and everything international is now EGA.    To the best of our knowledge, all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed.\n                 Following are the exceptions and/or unusual organizational structure that should be noted:\n                    Electricidad Enron de Guatemala S.A. actually reports up through ENA\n                    San Juan Gas Company, Inc. in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp. (100% owned)\n                    Enron American del Sur, S.A.  is an Enron Corp./Enron Transportation Services entity\n                    No entity called Enron Singapore .... more than likely Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company.\n \nEIM:         No Stadacona Paper Company but it  is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM \n                Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp. as the general partner and a list of Limited\n                Partners including ENA, Enron Corp. and a non-Enron entity (Salomon Brothers Holding Company, Inc.)\n \nENW:        Enron Net Works, LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp. company\n \nEWC:        The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp. which is owned by Smith Street Land Co., an Enron Corp. company, but many of the \n                 names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list.   For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas, S.A.; \n                 no Enron Wind UK, no Enron Wind India .... but regardless, they are all part of the EWC/EREC family.\n \nGLOBAL    These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration & Production, Inc., which is owned by Enron Corp., but one has indirect outside ownership.\n EP:           Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd., for instance, is owned by Enron Asst Holdings, which is owned by Enron Finance Partners, which is part of a complex ownership\n                 structure that includes one non-Enron entity (Zephyrus Investments, LLC) with a small interest.      \n                    \nAgain, I hope this information is helpful.  For the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track.

Following are my thoughts. First, I am not going to Netco. (Long story). Second, I have spoken with Ken Lay and Jeff McMahon about the continuation of RAC and my leading it. They both want RAC to continue and want me to lead it and also combine an internal audit function with RAC as well (to be determined more definitively). \n\nJim has also requested that some RAC folks be near his operation as you have which I totally understand. I think I will assign a couple people to his floor but keep the bulk of our operation on 28. We have counterparty credit files on 15,000 counterparties as well as Dash libraries and other info that require large secure space.\n\nMy final issue is that I have had three credit people leave this week so my situation is getting critical. I need to get Netco people away from 28 and get remaining RAC people sitting together and feeling like a team.

EOL passed us 25 Gas and 40 power scenarios of which we tested a subset of transactions.  Today's test went a bit smoother given we pushed for the counterparties, contracts to be setup in advance.  We will continue with the Gas settlement on Tuesday morning, along with SAP processing at 1:00pm.\n \nFrom a technical code perspective, there were no major interface issues.  Including TDS/ Sitara interface to Tagg as discussed earlier.\nErrors reported include continued NT userid \""pilot burn-in\"" issues, as well as replication issues with data.  Given we are processing in a very 'truncated' environment, downstream systems can have missing global data needed (regions, facilities, SAP information).  The open issues are being escalated and should be addressed by 10:00am tomorrow morning.\n \nThe goals of this regression test on Monday/ Tuesday are:\n1) regression test a subset of scenarios (ie Physical Gas Sale, Physical Power Supply, Financial Swap, Intercomapny) now that the Global Data is more stable (UBS internal counterparties, profit centers, desks/ books) \n2) Identify any reference to internal/ external screens that still have 'ENRON' reference, or 'EOL' reference\n3) Ensure we have the latest price curve data from updates (ie TAGG/ERMS)\n4) process new EOL data created for Monday.  To verify mid/ back office, including SAP processing.   EOL will also push data from a mock trading session for on 2/7 (see below) \n5) provide the test data scenarios for SAP testing (scheduled Tuesday 1pm).  SAP is completing their setup with the new controlling area for NetCo. \n6) Continue with NT Logins involved with PILOT until remaining are ported.\n \n \nAccomplishments/  what worked?\n1) Confirmation/ updates of most recent price curves into ERMS.  The data prior was from mid December.\n2) Working with only the subset of counterparties as authorized as 'Active'\n3) EOL deals did flow downstream.  However, the major were future periods that we cannot settle.  We modified the data to correspond to what downstream needed.\n4) Gas - Volume Management, Logistics, and leading into Settlement\n5) Power/ Financial  - EnPower/ Tagg, confirmations, leading into settlement\n \n \nWhat did not?\n1) Canada testing is still catching up, but improving.  They are identifying the counterparties, pipelines, test scenarios and anticipate continuing to test Tuesday.   \n2) Facilities missing, Canada pipelines missing, contracts not replicating into Unify (resolved). \n3) Unify Tagg Deal Load.  The Unify Tagg Deal load was discovered at 5pm, and will be addressed early Tuesday am.\n \nFocus on Tuesday\nGiven the new SAP environment has not been tested to date, we will monitor the Unify transmission/ SAP processing (scheduled for 1pm till).  \nThere is much risk within SAP given the new counterparties, entities, xref tables, SAP information is just being setup.  We will also validate the intercompany transactions created on Monday.\n \nNote:  Tuesday night (6pm - 8pm) is the scheduled NetCo test with Estate Shutdown.\n \nAttachments to provide more detail:\n    Integration Testing ISSUES.xls (see tab page for 0204)\n    0204 Global Data Setup AND transactions.xls  (See tab page for 0204 open issues)\n \n \nRegards,\n\nRegan Smith \nEnergy Operations Systems \nEnron Net Works \n713-853-9291 (wk); 281-850-7551 (cell) \n\n "", ""     \nThere will be two presentations tomorrow from UBS commencing at 2:30 p.m. (CST).

EOL passed =\nus 25 Gas and 40 power scenarios of which we tested a subset of transaction=\ns.  Today's test went a bit smoother given we pushed for the counterparties=\n, contracts to be setup in advance.  We will continue with the Gas settleme=\nnt on Tuesday morning, along with SAP processing at 1:00pm.\n=20\nFrom a technical code perspective, there were no major interface issues.  I=\nncluding TDS/ Sitara interface to Tagg as discussed earlier.\nErrors reported include continued NT userid \""pilot burn-in\"" issues, as well=\n as replication issues with data.  Given we are processing in a very 'trunc=\nated' environment, downstream systems can have missing global data needed (=\nregions, facilities, SAP information).  The open issues are being escalated=\n and should be addressed by 10:00am tomorrow morning.\n=20\nThe goals of this regression test on Monday/ Tuesday are:\n1) regression test a subset of scenarios (ie Physical Gas Sale, Physical Po=\nwer Supply, Financial Swap, Intercomapny) now that the Global Data is more =\nstable (UBS internal counterparties, profit centers, desks/ books)=20\n2) Identify any reference to internal/ external screens that still have 'EN=\nRON' reference, or 'EOL' reference\n3) Ensure we have the latest price curve data from updates (ie TAGG/ERMS)\n4) process new EOL data created for Monday.

But if that was to fall through, Canada would attempt to find its own white knight, so to speak. We had numerous expressions of interest and none of those have been pursued at this time.\""\nHouston-based Enron Corp. was negotiating yesterday with at least six potential buyers for its wholesale trading business in an auction that was part of efforts to reorganize itself under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The auction was expected to continue into the evening.\nIn Manhattan, U.S. bankruptcy judge Arthur J. Gonzalez scheduled a hearing for today to approve the sale.\nEnron Canada was Canada's largest market maker of natural gas and power until it was swept up in the failure of its indirect parent, which unraveled after disclosures that Enron Corp. had shifted billions of dollars in debt off its books. It was left saddled with at least US$40-billion in debt.\nEnron Corp.'s troubles deepened this week with revelations that the U.S. Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation. There was also an admission yesterday by the firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, that a \""significant but undetermined\"" number of documents related to the company had been destroyed.\nMr. Milnthorp said the investigation \""has nothing to do with Enron Canada.\""\nThe Canadian unit attempted last month to distance itself from the parent and re-emerge as an independent company but gave up after losing a bid in an Alberta court to keep counterparties from unwinding contracts, its major asset.\nMr. Milnthorp said the Canadian arm was packaged as part of a deal to sell Enron's overall trading business, which buys and sells oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, metals, coal, forest products and steel, and a variety of contracts and derivatives. The company would get cash and a 49% stake in a new partnership called \""Netco,\"" short for New Energy Trading Company, under the proposed sale. The trading unit generated about 90% of Enron Corp.'s US$100.8- billion in revenue in 2000.\nMr. Milnthorp said 75 employees in Calgary and Toronto were laid off after last month's court proceedings and trading was suspended because of lack of confidence in the market.\n\""To be successful in this business, you need a very solid balance sheet that creates the confidence necessary to enter into long-term transactions. That's been one of the key criteria through the auction process,\"" he said.\nEnron Canada's remaining employees are \""trying to manage the estate and trying to work hard to co-operate with our customers to get them paid,\"" he said.\nThe unit is cash rich from the sale last month of its interest in the Sundance B power-generating plant outside of Edmonton.\nBidders for all or parts of the trading operation include Citigroup Inc., the largest financial services company, UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, and BP PLC, one of the largest oil and gas companies.\nccattaneo@nationalpost.com <mailto:ccattaneo@nationalpost.com>"", ""Please review with regards to changes in MOCK test plans tomorrow for processing ETX deals:\n \nLocation:  We are moving the location from the 25th flloor labs to ECS 05442\n    -> ECS 05442 (near Dermott color printer sign; center of room    \n    -> We will have 8 computers.

But if that was to fall through, Canada would attempt to find its own white knight, so to speak. We had numerous expressions of interest and none of those have been pursued at this time.\""\nHouston-based Enron Corp. was negotiating yesterday with at least six potential buyers for its wholesale trading business in an auction that was part of efforts to reorganize itself under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The auction was expected to continue into the evening.\nIn Manhattan, U.S. bankruptcy judge Arthur J. Gonzalez scheduled a hearing for today to approve the sale.\nEnron Canada was Canada's largest market maker of natural gas and power until it was swept up in the failure of its indirect parent, which unraveled after disclosures that Enron Corp. had shifted billions of dollars in debt off its books. It was left saddled with at least US$40-billion in debt.\nEnron Corp.'s troubles deepened this week with revelations that the U.S. Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation. There was also an admission yesterday by the firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, that a \""significant but undetermined\"" number of documents related to the company had been destroyed.\nMr. Milnthorp said the investigation \""has nothing to do with Enron Canada.\""\nThe Canadian unit attempted last month to distance itself from the parent and re-emerge as an independent company but gave up after losing a bid in an Alberta court to keep counterparties from unwinding contracts, its major asset.\nMr. Milnthorp said the Canadian arm was packaged as part of a deal to sell Enron's overall trading business, which buys and sells oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, metals, coal, forest products and steel, and a variety of contracts and derivatives. The company would get cash and a 49% stake in a new partnership called \""Netco,\"" short for New Energy Trading Company, under the proposed sale. The trading unit generated about 90% of Enron Corp.'s US$100.8- billion in revenue in 2000.\nMr. Milnthorp said 75 employees in Calgary and Toronto were laid off after last month's court proceedings and trading was suspended because of lack of confidence in the market.\n\""To be successful in this business, you need a very solid balance sheet that creates the confidence necessary to enter into long-term transactions. That's been one of the key criteria through the auction process,\"" he said.\nEnron Canada's remaining employees are \""trying to manage the estate and trying to work hard to co-operate with our customers to get them paid,\"" he said.\nThe unit is cash rich from the sale last month of its interest in the Sundance B power-generating plant outside of Edmonton.\nBidders for all or parts of the trading operation include Citigroup Inc., the largest financial services company, UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, and BP PLC, one of the largest oil and gas companies.\nccattaneo@nationalpost.com <mailto:ccattaneo@nationalpost.com>"", ""The new meeting Louise Kitchen refers to in her email below will commence this Thursday, Feb. 7 @ 10:30 a.m.(CST) for 15 minutes in Conf RM 06716.

(ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could\nreceive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s\n(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday\nby the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,\n2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full\ncalendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he\nterminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. \n  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the\nresignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that\ntime, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. \n  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any\nrelated tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an \""excess\nparachute payment,\"" according to the filing. \n  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. \n  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is\nentitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment\nwithin the 60 days. \n  Houston-based Enron is a utilities and communications company. -Dan Lowrey;\nDow Jones Newswires; 202-393-7402; dan.lowrey@dowjones.com \n \n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires  13-11-01\n  1428GMT(AP-DJ-11-13-01 1428GMT)\n\nSymbols:\n  US;DYN US;ENE \n\n  13-Nov-2001  14:28:54 GMT\nSource DJES   - Dow Jones Energy Service\nCategories:\n  I/ELC I/GAS I/UES I/XISL N/CNW N/DJWI N/DPG N/LNG N/NRG N/WEI M/NND M/UTI\n  P/NRG R/NAPW R/NERC R/NME R/TX R/US R/USS MST/I/ELC MST/I/GAS MST/I MST/N/LNG\n  MST/R/NME MST/R/US/TX MST/R/US ""]","[""2001-10-25 18:36:26"", ""2001-11-02 13:16:58"", ""2001-11-02 13:53:18"", ""2001-11-13 14:35:04"", ""2001-11-21 17:05:57"", ""2001-12-12 16:33:13"", ""2002-01-03 17:31:23"", ""2002-01-11 11:39:10"", ""2002-01-11 11:41:44"", ""2002-01-11 11:43:56"", ""2002-01-23 17:59:36"", ""2002-01-28 17:10:13"", ""2002-01-30 13:41:47"", ""2002-01-30 13:53:53"", ""2002-01-30 14:53:30"", ""2002-01-31 16:58:07"", ""2002-01-31 17:22:07"", ""2002-01-31 17:25:38"", ""2002-01-31 19:22:23"", ""2002-02-01 12:41:20"", ""2002-02-06 17:23:23"", ""2002-02-11 11:15:52"", ""2002-02-11 13:20:46"", ""2002-02-13 14:04:52"", ""2001-10-25 18:17:07"", ""2001-11-13 12:50:45"", ""2001-12-05 18:54:19"", ""2001-12-10 13:27:54"", ""2001-12-13 14:16:23"", ""2001-12-19 13:14:54"", ""2001-12-31 15:53:43"", ""2002-01-02 18:04:42"", ""2002-01-02 21:43:49"", ""2002-01-08 20:10:11"", ""2002-01-23 17:31:09"", ""2002-01-28 18:36:51"", ""2002-01-30 00:08:41"", ""2002-01-30 13:31:49"", ""2002-01-30 19:34:52"", ""2002-02-01 13:28:59"", ""2002-02-01 21:51:47"", ""2002-02-06 16:11:07"", ""2002-02-06 21:09:37"", ""2002-02-15 14:23:27""]"

She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -\n\n1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the \""Dynegy transition\"" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven. [Geaccone, Tracy]  The lower capital is probably from the revised plan.  I am okey with the other assumption. \n2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers? [Geaccone, Tracy]  Costs have been reduced due to Dynegy transition.  If we assume under our control, costs would be the same or slightly lower.  I would propose the same for now. \n3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the \""contract roll off\"" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative. [Geaccone, Tracy]    I think this is a good assumption \n4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more \""reasonable\"" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. \n5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.\n\nAny thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.

Foothills agreed to reflect the suggested changes to the model (An=\ndy is supposed to send out a summary of the discussion) and provided an ele=\nctronic copy of the model for withdrawn partners' review. Withdrawn partner=\ns agreed to give their comments/feedback on the model to Foothills until 11=\n/27/01 and another meeting to reach an agreement on economic model/toll was=\n scheduled for 12/03/01 or 12/04/01. The data from economic/toll model will=\n be used in commercial proposal/presentation to the ANS producers which ANN=\nGTC intends to have by 12/20/01. Tim and I will review Foothills' cash flow=\n and COS model and prepare comments.\n\nOverall, the participants though that the current Foothills model ($0.43/MM=\nBtu toll for Alaska section) has very aggressive assumptions in many ways, =\nand it is very likely that the toll will be increased significantly after a=\nll the appropriate revisions are made. The following are the main discussio=\nn points of the meeting. Item 1 and 2 are expected to have a very large imp=\nact on the toll.\n\n1) Capex and Opex need to have annual/monthly escalation (current model has=\n 0% escalation). For example, Foothills sensitivity analysis shows that 2.5=\n% Capex escalation would increase the toll by $0.20. Numbers such as 1.5% f=\nor Capex and 2.5% for Opex were thrown during the meeting, but more reviews=\n need to be done regarding appropriate escalation rates. Do you have any op=\ninion on this, Bryan?\n\n2) Foothills is using Flowthrough method (using cash taxes in COS calculati=\non) to calculate income taxes that go into the Cost of Service and might be=\n underestimating Cost of Service. Tim thought that the Flowthrough method w=\nill not fly because of previous cases in which that method was not allowed =\nby IRS and FERC. Foothills said that they can still have same toll under No=\nrmalized tax method by changing the depreciation number, but Tim was concer=\nned that it might force the partnership to record negative depreciation. Fo=\nothills declined our request to share their Cost of Service model and insis=\nted that we calculate the toll ourselves based on the information in the ca=\nsh flow model. They agreed to provide a hard copy of their Cost of Service =\nmodel in the end, but Tim and I were under impression that Foothills was tr=\nying to lower the toll as much as they can. Tim was also concerned about le=\nvelized toll approach because of FERC might lower allowed return in the lat=\ner rate cases and more analysis needs to done regradign this. Please correc=\nt me if I am wrong here, Tim.\n\n3) OM & A is currently estimated to be 1% of Capex but this might be too lo=\nw (OM&A in more latest cost estimate by Foothills is approx. 1.5% of total =\nCapex).\n\n4) The Withdrawn Partners' historical contributions ($228 million) will be =\nadded to the Rate Base, but this might be dropped if necessary. Success fee=\n of $40 million should be included in the project budget.\n\n5) Working Capital will be added to the project cost. The Line Pack cost (1=\n4.5 Bcf for the whole section) was assumed to be borne by ANS producers but=\n some participants highly doubted that that would be the case. The Line Pac=\nk gas might have to be bought by the Partnership or the Producers will at l=\neast demand certain return on their gas sitting in the pipeline for 25 year=\ns.\n\n6) For Return on Capital and AFUDC, 14% ROE and 8% Interest on Debt assumin=\ng 30/70 capital structure is likely to be kept. However, the current drawdo=\nwn schedule assumes construction financing available from the very beginnin=\ng, which will not be true. Certain assumptions should be made on the financ=\nial close date and commercial agreement/preliminary determination date to c=\nalculate AFUDC more accurately.\n\n7) Current financing assumption in the model is a 25 year bank loan with ba=\nlloon amortization and DSCR of 1.6. In reality, the initial bank loans will=\n be of shorter maturity (5-15 years) and certain roll-over financing will b=\ne unavoidable. It is also likely that the loans will have multiple tranches=\n with different terms, interest rate, seniority etc.=20\n\n8) There is significant currency risk associated with Canadian section of t=\nhe ANGTS considering that some sources of capital, revenues and part of ope=\nrating expenses will be in Canadian dollars. A mechanis to mitigate currenc=\ny risk should be in place and there might be some costs associated with it.\n\n9) Property taxes of 2% in Alaska seems high, but Property taxes during con=\nstruction period should be added.=20\n\nLastly, there is about $300 million difference ($4,336-$4035) between ETS c=\nurrent cost estimates and the cost estimate in the Foothills model, excludi=\nng IDC and AFUDC. Another engineering estimate might have to be dome for la=\nrger pipe size (46 or 48 inch) as noted in Bryan's email. =20\n\nThanks,=20\n\nJB=20\n\nJebong Lee=20\n713-853-9722 office=20\n713-306-8658 cell"", ""None that I am aware.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tHoward, Kevin A.  \nSent:\tWednesday, November 07, 2001 8:11 AM\nTo:\tFossum, Drew; Hayslett, Rod\nSubject:\tNotre Dame\n\nAny updates or new docs?"", ""Jeff, I will arrive late evening tonight.

Prior to the move, we had a very efficient, open configuration that let us work together as a unified team.  \n\nAfter the move, we are located on 3 different floors.   Besides the general impact on team unity, this move also means that our evening staff work alone on separate floors, rather than in a group.  It means fewer individuals to cover customer calls.  It means having more equipment to cover the day to day business.   I have worked hard to calm the team that this arrangement is just temporary and that we will eventually be put back together as a team.\n\nPrior to our move I constantly questioned whether our move was necessary.  I asked about smaller, more practical changes to fit more people on the floor.  And, I specifically asked about whether Enron issues might impact the groups desire to continue to spend $7-$10 million -- even as I reluctantly packed up my boxes.\n\nI hope you can appreciate that the current seating arrangement is a serious issue for my team and one that generates constant questions as my staff meetings.

Uncomfortable with UBS's committment to the business\n\t\t2. Surprised that no one from UBS has spoken directly with him\n\t\t3. Seems like he wants to build/run a team and is motivated by money.\n\t\t4. His interperetation of the contract is that even if this deal fails, his would be bound by a none compete until the end.\n\n\tSolution:  Money alone is not enough because does not address 1 and 2.  He needs someone (senior) from UBS to spend some time with him to:\n\t\t   (a) help him fell more comfortable with UBS's committment; (b) get him excited by the possiblity to lead/shape/direct the weather group\n\t\t   (this notion seemed to catch his interest during our discussion with him); (c) and present him with a new deal (no more of this aim for 80%\n\t\t   happy bullshit).  This new deal will need considerably less restrictive language--talk with Hunter about specifics.\n\nAdam:\tIssue:  1. Has interest in returing to the air force (his window to do so is until July 7th.)\n\n\tSolution:  Appears that money is not his first priority.  Any offer of money that precludes him from the July 7th window will be unsuccessful!\n\t\t   Our strategy needs to be one that gives him some respectable money that he can keep as long as he stays until June 1st (after he is\n\t\t   committed it may be possible to persuade him to stay longer).  He will not accept an offer that takes away his air force option!!!!!!  Also,\n\t\t   I think signing him will be alot easier once others have committed.\n\nJose:\tIssue:\t1. Recongnizes that senior management (You, Greg, and Louise) have done a good job closing the deal, but have failed to address HR\n\t\t    issues.  He thinks that this failure has existed much longer than just during the bankrupcy.  (Quoted, \""Mike had to fight way to hard\n\t\t    to get the very basic things for his team since day 1.\"")\n\n\tSolution:  The most difficult of the three to sell.

VARGAS \nCopyright 2002 Houston Chronicle \nIsn't it just like Houston to go for seconds? \nThis title-craving city has been named the fattest, plumpest, most rotund city in America by Men's Fitness for a second consecutive year. \nWeigh to go. \nFattest cities 1. Houston 2. Chicago 3. Detroit 4. Philadelphia 5. Dallas 6. Columbus, Ohio 7. San Antonio 8. Fort Worth 9. St. Louis 10. Indianapolis Fittest cities 1. Colorado Springs, Colo. 2. Denver 3. San Diego 4. Seattle 5. San Francisco 6. Virginia Beach, Va. 7. Honolulu 8. Sacramento, Calif. 9. Albuquerque, N.M. 10. Boston \t\n\""Houstonians need to turn off the TV and get out to their parks where a variety of programs for kids and adults are offered for free,\"" the magazine writes. \nLast year, Houstonians viewed the national magazine as a svelte bully picking on the chubby little kid on the playground and reacted like a protective, angry mother. \nIn 2002, the message is soaking in like a juicy, half-pound hamburger patty on a freshly toasted bun. \n\""The first year we were kind of upset because we weren't happy or agreed with the ranking because they took into account air quality and other things people can't control,\"" says Shadston Pittman, fitness coordinator for the city's Parks and Recreation Department. \""This year the ranking is motivating because we have some projects in place now. I think we can show the world (weight loss) is a priority for us. \n\""But they still got us. Again.\"" \nIn fact, Pittman thought Indianapolis would get the top honor. Sorry, they came in 10th. \n\""I didn't think we'd be number one because of the proactive steps we took,\"" he says. \nFor the country's 50 largest cities, the magazine took existing data and issued grades in 16 categories such as overweight and obesity rates (D), air quality (F), TV viewing habits (F), water quality (D), parks and open space (D+), nutrition (B-) and climate (C). \nWhen the grades were tallied, Houston once again found itself at the head of the class, albeit the one with all the detention-serving kids. \nThe Men's Fitness issue hits newsstands Tuesday. (Meanwhile, we apparently should hit the treadmill.) \nNot to be outdone, other major Texas cities also found themselves on the heavy side. \nDallas ranked fifth. San Antonio was seventh. Fort Worth ranked eighth and El Paso weighed in at 14th. \nThe only Texas city on the light side was Austin, ranked as the 16th fittest. The fittest city was Colorado Springs, Colo. \nKaren Calabro, coordinator of health promotion and health education at the University of Texas-Houston Health Science Center, says although she doesn't put much stock into the magazine's formula, Houstonians could stand to shed a few pounds. \n\""We could all lose some weight. Me included,\"" the registered dietitian says. \nHouston, Calabro says, isn't the only city with a caloric-intake and sedentary epidemic. \nNationally, 55 percent of adults are overweight or obese, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. \nAs your waistline expands so do your chances of developing diseases or conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease or diabetes, Calabro says. \n\""A big part of this obesity problem,\"" she says, \""is that we're not exercising\"" -- not even when the opportunity presents itself for a brisk walk. \nWe opt for the elevator when the stairs call our name. We see escalators as our new best friend. And we drive to the corner store for ice cream. \nBut Pittman hopes to alter our lifestyles and ballooning image. \nAfter Houston earned the first unsolicited title, Pittman and two other city officials visited Philadelphia, which owned the \""fattest\"" ranking in 2000. \nPhilly started a citywide campaign called \""Fun, Fit and Free\"" to get its residents to slim down. Last year, Philadelphia fell out of the top spot and this year is in fourth place. \nPittman, who is also a personal trainer and has been fitness coordinator for just a year, says Houston's version will not be under one umbrella slogan like Philadelphia's. However, there will be several endeavors to involve as many people as possible. \nThe city's get-fit effort will kick off Jan. 17 when the city teams up with the Subway sandwich chain to bring the Subway Challenge to Houston. \nThe problem is so serious that Subway is sending its big-gun spokesman to the Jan. 17 event. \nFrom 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. outside City Hall, 900 Smith, participants can meet Jared Fogle, who lost 245 pounds on a diet of low-fat, low-calorie Subway sandwiches, and receive a pledge card good for sandwich discounts and a two-week free membership to Bally Total Fitness. \n\""That Jared's a nice guy,\"" Pittman says. \""That's his full-time job now.\"" \nPeople would agree that losing weight is a full-time task. \nThe city will also team up with the Texas Fruit and Produce Growers Association and Central Market to promote the \""Five a Day\"" message of eating five serving of fruits and vegetables a day. That effort kicks off Jan. 22. \n\""We're not saying everyone has to run 10 miles a day around Memorial Park,\"" Pittman says. \""We're talking just simple lifestyle changes.\"" \nLater this year, Houston will join other major Texas cities in a program called \""Shape Up Texas\"" to improve health and wellness among Texans. That's not a bad idea considering Texas cities make up 20 percent of the fat list and four of the top eight. \nMayor Lee Brown says he will do his part to cut out the fat at City Hall. \nBrown, who has put on a few pounds since taking office, says he isn't surprised by Houston's expansive reputation. \n\""I'm afraid I've contributed to that,\"" he says. \nBrown says he will set an example for the rest of the city by losing some weight himself, not through a diet but by walking and riding his bike more. However, he wouldn't reveal how much weight he planned to shed. \nPittman applauds the mayor's words about weight loss. \n\""It's great when you have someone of that stature visibly being a speaker for health and fitness,\"" he says. \nThe last thing we want is a three-peat in 2003.

Given that we are coming to the end of the heating season our best opportunities to make money over the next little while will be with respect to storage, storage arbitrage, and opportunities surrounding the injection season.   Having this in mind I think the best place to start is with the pipe that has the most storage capabilities and flexibility, and I think that is Columbia Gas Transmission.  I am inviting everyone to attend a meeting Tuesday at 3:00 (location to follow) to discuss the who, what, where, when, why, and how.   In preparation for the meeting we need to have information regarding the pipe:\n\n1)\tWe need the operational capabilities of the pipe.   This should include major receipt points, delivery points, through put capability, line pack balances, and storage facilities (both owned by the pipeline as well as third parties).  Expect to discuss which regions are the bottle necks, and what operational restrictions or advantages individual locations have.

We have discussed ENE's need to improve counter\nparty confidence on a number of occasions over the last few weeks, and we\nbelieve counter party confidence deteriorated further based on the\ninformation included in the 10Q, and the strong negative reaction in the\nstock and bond markets yesterday.  The tone of our discussions with\ncompeting traders and marketers (representative of ENE's counter\nparties--which are critical in maintaining ENE's volumes) is becoming more\nnegative.  While ENE is continuing to confirm that volumes are improving\nsince the lows on November 9, our market intelligence is suggesting\nimproment has stalled.  In addition and probably related, ENE's liquidity\nposition seems to be continuing to deteriorate despite significant recent\ncapital infusions.  We are reducing 4Q01 estimates to reflect lower volume\nand margin assumptions.  What would get us more comfortable?  ENE 8K\ndisclosure confirming higher volume and decent margins (ENE has committed\nto provide 4Q guidance by early-mid December, and/or a change in the tone\nof the counter parties that would suggest they are increasing trading\nactivities with ENE.\n\nOPINION ON THE STOCKS:\n   ENE.  No change in our opinion on ENE--the upside potential is simply\n   not worth the downside risk.\n   DYN.  DYN is likely to benefit in almost all outcomes.  If our concerns\n   about counter party confidence prove to be wrong, the upside associated\n   with the accretion in the transaction would likely be huge.  However, we\n   sense DYN is getting frustrated by continued restatement of earnings,\n   unexpected debt triggers and worse than expected liquidity problems.  If\n   the transaction falls apart, DYN would have some transaction costs that\n   would negatively impact cash flow in the near-term, but DYN would\n   benefit from gaining market share and hiring some of ENE's talent away\n   longer term.  A potential downside case for DYN is that DYN retrades the\n   deal on recent information, but is forced to reduced its flexibility to\n   terminate the transaction through material adverse change\n   considerations, this out come would concern us.  We continue to believe\n   DYN is a solid long-term holding for investors.  However, we are\n   recommending caution with new money, due to our belief that DYN still\n   has $5/sh to $7/sh of \""deal\"" premium factored into the current stock\n   price which could be at risk if the deal fails.  We do not believe DYN\n   has significant accounts receivable exposure to ENE in the event the ENE\n   has further liquidity problems (we believe DYN's trading agreement with\n   ENE limits exposure to maybe $100 to $150 MM).\n\nCOUNTER PARTY INCENTIVES:  ENE identified in its 10Q that transaction\nvolume (especially long-term transactions) have declined since the 3Q.  If\nyou are a utility or industrial customer, why enter into a long-term\ntransaction with ENE?  Why not go directly to DYN or diversify with other\nsuppliers?  If you are a natural gas or power producer, why create the\naccount receivable risk?  If you are a counter party, strategically why\nwould you contribute to the continuation of the ENE machine--to the\nultimate benefit of strengthening another competitor (DYN)?  We believe\nthat ENE is offering attractive financial incentives (premium purchases\nand/or discounted sales) to entice counter parties to trade with them.\nHowever, this would also suggest ENE margins may be getting squeezed.\n\nEPS ESTIMATES (new/old/consensus):\n   4Q01-$0.20/0.35/0.42, FY01-$1.55/1.70/1.78, FY02-$1.50/1.50/1.90\n   We are reducing expectations for margins in the Wholesale segment from\n   9cts/mmbtu to 7cts/mmbtu--negatively impacting 4Q EPS by 10cts/sh.  In\n   addition, we expect contributions from Enron Energy Services will be\n   lower due to challenges in closing long-term transactions (much of EES's\n   earnings are mark-to-market recognition of the value created in\n   long-term agreeements) impacting our estimate by 5cts/sh.\n\n\n*****************************************************************************************************\n\n\n\nThis e-mail is based on information obtained from sources which Simmons &\nCompany International believes to be reliable, but Simmons & Company\nInternational does not represent or warrant its accuracy.

Following are my thoughts. First, I am not going to Netco. (Long story). Second, I have spoken with Ken Lay and Jeff McMahon about the continuation of RAC and my leading it. They both want RAC to continue and want me to lead it and also combine an internal audit function with RAC as well (to be determined more definitively). \n\nJim has also requested that some RAC folks be near his operation as you have which I totally understand. I think I will assign a couple people to his floor but keep the bulk of our operation on 28. We have counterparty credit files on 15,000 counterparties as well as Dash libraries and other info that require large secure space.\n\nMy final issue is that I have had three credit people leave this week so my situation is getting critical. I need to get Netco people away from 28 and get remaining RAC people sitting together and feeling like a team.

Jim Fallon will be managing the latter function and I believe he is staying in the new building for now.\n\nWe need to ensure that we have the appropriate folks from RAC engaged in the on-going concern function. I'd prefer that we continue to have them located near our floors vs. move to another location (as I hear through the grapevine).

There are a few, however, that may be incorrectly categorized, as follows:\n \nEA:             ECT Non U.S. Payroll Company (there is no such entity, but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA)\n                   Enron Capital & Trade Resources in London, UK  (may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited)\n \nEBS:           Broadband Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (actually comes up to Corp. through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance)\n \nEEOS:        Enron Engineering & Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp.\n                   The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd. whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe.  \n \nEES:           Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity\n                    The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities Services/Limbach companies\n \nEGA:         Here's where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with \n                 complicated, multi-layers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp. ownership.  As you know all of the old subsets (i.e. APACHI, CALME, etc.) have\n                 gone away and everything international is now EGA.    To the best of our knowledge, all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed.\n                 Following are the exceptions and/or unusual organizational structure that should be noted:\n                    Electricidad Enron de Guatemala S.A. actually reports up through ENA\n                    San Juan Gas Company, Inc. in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp. (100% owned)\n                    Enron American del Sur, S.A.  is an Enron Corp./Enron Transportation Services entity\n                    No entity called Enron Singapore .... more than likely Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company.\n \nEIM:         No Stadacona Paper Company but it  is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM \n                Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp. as the general partner and a list of Limited\n                Partners including ENA, Enron Corp. and a non-Enron entity (Salomon Brothers Holding Company, Inc.)\n \nENW:        Enron Net Works, LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp. company\n \nEWC:        The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp. which is owned by Smith Street Land Co., an Enron Corp. company, but many of the \n                 names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list.   For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas, S.A.; \n                 no Enron Wind UK, no Enron Wind India .... but regardless, they are all part of the EWC/EREC family.\n \nGLOBAL    These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration & Production, Inc., which is owned by Enron Corp., but one has indirect outside ownership.\n EP:           Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd., for instance, is owned by Enron Asst Holdings, which is owned by Enron Finance Partners, which is part of a complex ownership\n                 structure that includes one non-Enron entity (Zephyrus Investments, LLC) with a small interest.      \n                    \nAgain, I hope this information is helpful.

Before I turn to the organizational=\n changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t=\nhe company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are b=\ny their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of t=\nhis group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had =\nthat responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re=\nsponsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven=\n by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat=\ned group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also =\nvery decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is =\nnot easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor=\nk, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we =\nshared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=\n have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=\n are leaving for all you have done.\n\nAs to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =\nme that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=\nctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =\nability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee=\nd to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all =\nU.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, =\nJim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j=\nointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of =\nthe group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h=\nelp Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=\ndership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=\nty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =\nbe led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La=\nst, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o=\nn California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part=\n of the Wholesale electricity team).\n\nSteve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =\ndevelopment effort along with Dan Allegretti.\n\nWith the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=\n a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=\nislative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=\nill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=\n will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=\nelopment efforts across the U.S.\n\nMuch of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti=\nnue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, =\ntaking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi=\nm will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con=\ntinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over su=\npport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market=\ns, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue=\n to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government=\n affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout=\nh America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts=\n, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.\n\nI am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs =\nto provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Comm=\nittee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman,=\n Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord=\n, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also con=\ntinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry King=\nerski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am form=\ning a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of =\nJose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself=\n.\n\nNo organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf=\nect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more pre=\npared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as th=\ne future unfolds for the company.\n\nOne final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through =\nthis uncertain and troubled period for the company.

He picked up a large empty\nmayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks.  He then asked the\nstudents if the jar was full?  They agreed that it was. The professor\npicked up a box of  sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand\nfilled up everything else. \""Now,\"" said the professor, \""I want you to\nrecognize that this is your life.\n\n\""The rocks are the important things - your family, your partner, your\nhealth, your children - things that if everything else was lost and only\nthey  remained, your life would still be full.

If you spend all your  time and energy on the\nsmall stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to\nyou.\""\n\nBut then a student took the jar which the other students and the professor\nagreed was full, and  proceeded to pour in a can of beer.

I would like to add that although Midland cannot discontinue service to ENA for failure to pay the $88,816.33 and $39,881.55 invoices, Midland can shut off service if ENA fails to pay any future invoices. So, it's imperative that someone from Northern very closely monitor the situation with ENA and Midland to ensure that ENA makes the necessary payments. In addition, the bankruptcy court may require ENA to provide Midland with \""adequate assurance\"" of future payments.

($88,816.33) and Nov. ($39,881.55) Midland Power Coop electric bills to ENA have not been paid, and probably won't be until the bankruptcy proceeding unfolds (if at all).\n3)  Under bankruptcy law, a utility cannot discontinue service to a debtor for not paying invoices outstanding at the time bankruptcy is filed and Bill Rapp has asked ENA's bankruptcy attorneys to provide the attached notice to Midlands Power Cooperative.\n4)  Under supervision of the bankruptcy court, future invoices received after bankruptcy was filed (Dec 2) will be paid by ENA (if they have the cash?).\n5)  ENA's nomination of 2,010 dth/d of \""Monthly Fuel Gas Payable\"" from NNG has been confirmed and is flowing.  (This is their source of cash!?)\n6)  Gas Accounting will continue to pay the \""Monthly Demand Charge\"" ($64,549), and the \""Monthly Peak Compression Service Charges\"" (ranges from $300 to $40,000).  The next payment is not due until the end of December.\n7)  ENA's O&M payment to NNG for motor operation ($4,072.82) will be billed on the 20th of each month.  One month's payment should have been outstanding when bankruptcy was filed and therefore not paid, however, it was actually paid to NNG on Dec. 6th.\n8)  ENA's next $320,000 \""Peak Associated Payment\"" is not due to NNG until July 1, 2002.\n\nThere is no certainty when dealing with a bankrupt entity, however, this is where we are today.

We were told that star performers will be retained.  At what profit level do we become star performers?\n\nI understand you and your staff have a tremendous number of things that need to be accomplished.  As I talk with my peers, the most important thing on our minds is if we will have a job and what we will be paid.  John was saying that in a few months this issue would be addressed.  My immediate concern is to secure employment while there are still positions available with other companies.  I will accept the first lucrative offer that is made to me.  My peers have expressed the same sentiment.  In a few months, there may not be any jobs left.   We have to may hay while the sun shines.  We all have been bombarded with calls from executive search firms.  We are all racing for a limited number of jobs that promise substantially higher salaries.\n\nWhat we need on this floor is some assurances.  Maybe it should be in the form of granting bonuses now and offering employment contracts.  We need some exact numbers in the form of dates, salaries, and bonus plans. \n\nScott Neal brought up this same question several times and John said he understood how critical this situation is.  If there are only trader track personnel left to run this company, will Dynegy still be interested?\n\nGetting a bonus this year that reflects the work I put in is critical.  It is no where near as critical the issue of making sure my children have food on the table.  I do not have two months to wait to find out that the compensation I will be offered ends up being less than what a third party is willing to pay, or the bonus program is a based on a amount to appease me when I may have passed up a percentage deal.\n\nPlease sense the urgency that my peers and I are feeling.\n\nTom Donohoe ""]","[""2001-11-13 19:16:36"", ""2001-11-13 14:58:02""]"

We have discussed ENE's need to improve counter\nparty confidence on a number of occasions over the last few weeks, and we\nbelieve counter party confidence deteriorated further based on the\ninformation included in the 10Q, and the strong negative reaction in the\nstock and bond markets yesterday.  The tone of our discussions with\ncompeting traders and marketers (representative of ENE's counter\nparties--which are critical in maintaining ENE's volumes) is becoming more\nnegative.  While ENE is continuing to confirm that volumes are improving\nsince the lows on November 9, our market intelligence is suggesting\nimproment has stalled.  In addition and probably related, ENE's liquidity\nposition seems to be continuing to deteriorate despite significant recent\ncapital infusions.  We are reducing 4Q01 estimates to reflect lower volume\nand margin assumptions.  What would get us more comfortable?  ENE 8K\ndisclosure confirming higher volume and decent margins (ENE has committed\nto provide 4Q guidance by early-mid December, and/or a change in the tone\nof the counter parties that would suggest they are increasing trading\nactivities with ENE.\n\nOPINION ON THE STOCKS:\n   ENE.  No change in our opinion on ENE--the upside potential is simply\n   not worth the downside risk.\n   DYN.  DYN is likely to benefit in almost all outcomes.  If our concerns\n   about counter party confidence prove to be wrong, the upside associated\n   with the accretion in the transaction would likely be huge.  However, we\n   sense DYN is getting frustrated by continued restatement of earnings,\n   unexpected debt triggers and worse than expected liquidity problems.  If\n   the transaction falls apart, DYN would have some transaction costs that\n   would negatively impact cash flow in the near-term, but DYN would\n   benefit from gaining market share and hiring some of ENE's talent away\n   longer term.  A potential downside case for DYN is that DYN retrades the\n   deal on recent information, but is forced to reduced its flexibility to\n   terminate the transaction through material adverse change\n   considerations, this out come would concern us.  We continue to believe\n   DYN is a solid long-term holding for investors.  However, we are\n   recommending caution with new money, due to our belief that DYN still\n   has $5/sh to $7/sh of \""deal\"" premium factored into the current stock\n   price which could be at risk if the deal fails.  We do not believe DYN\n   has significant accounts receivable exposure to ENE in the event the ENE\n   has further liquidity problems (we believe DYN's trading agreement with\n   ENE limits exposure to maybe $100 to $150 MM).\n\nCOUNTER PARTY INCENTIVES:  ENE identified in its 10Q that transaction\nvolume (especially long-term transactions) have declined since the 3Q.  If\nyou are a utility or industrial customer, why enter into a long-term\ntransaction with ENE?  Why not go directly to DYN or diversify with other\nsuppliers?  If you are a natural gas or power producer, why create the\naccount receivable risk?  If you are a counter party, strategically why\nwould you contribute to the continuation of the ENE machine--to the\nultimate benefit of strengthening another competitor (DYN)?  We believe\nthat ENE is offering attractive financial incentives (premium purchases\nand/or discounted sales) to entice counter parties to trade with them.\nHowever, this would also suggest ENE margins may be getting squeezed.\n\nEPS ESTIMATES (new/old/consensus):\n   4Q01-$0.20/0.35/0.42, FY01-$1.55/1.70/1.78, FY02-$1.50/1.50/1.90\n   We are reducing expectations for margins in the Wholesale segment from\n   9cts/mmbtu to 7cts/mmbtu--negatively impacting 4Q EPS by 10cts/sh.  In\n   addition, we expect contributions from Enron Energy Services will be\n   lower due to challenges in closing long-term transactions (much of EES's\n   earnings are mark-to-market recognition of the value created in\n   long-term agreeements) impacting our estimate by 5cts/sh.\n\n\n*****************************************************************************************************\n\n\n\nThis e-mail is based on information obtained from sources which Simmons &\nCompany International believes to be reliable, but Simmons & Company\nInternational does not represent or warrant its accuracy.

I pointed out the Section 542 of the bankruptcy code requires them to turn over property of the estate and our position is they don't have a valid lien.  I also indicated they were opening themselves up to damages for violation of the bankrupcty stay.  John indicated that since this issue (whether Article 7 of the UCC applies to natural gas storage)  would be a case of first impression they would be willing to litigate considering the amounts involved.  Summary - They are not willing to release the gas.  They are willing to release gas in excess of the amounts we owe to them, but only if stipulated that they are not waving their rights to assert the warehouseman's lien.  At this point it is probably better to get some gas and then decide whether to litigate the remainder.  Thoughts?  Stuart,  the answers to your questions are inserted below.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tZisman, Stuart  \nSent:\tFriday, January 11, 2002 11:02 AM\nTo:\tNemec, Gerald\nCc:\tRedmond, Brian; Parks, Joe\nSubject:\tBridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails\n\nI think we need to crystallize, in very short order, what the approval process will be for the sale of the Pad Gas in Storage Caverns #13/#14 to Bridgeline.  I will send you via fax the proposed deal sheet.\n\nSeveral interesting points from the meeting:\n\n1)  Bridgeline is of the view that 3/12/2002 (we thought it was 4/402) is the last day on which they are obligated to reimburse Enron for the Dow Lease - Any thoughts?  Who is right?; The contract states that they are obligated to reimburse through the earlier of July 1, 2002 or 114 days following the 4 BCF Date.  The 4 BCF date is defined at the day of the last Enron Pad Gas Payment.  The last Pad Gas Payment (for the month of November) was due on 12/10/01.  Thus, the 114 days should run from 12/10/01, which puts right around 4/4/02. \n\n2)  Their plan (assuming our deal goes through) is to amend and assume the existing lease - and get Dow to expressly release LRCI from any and all claims/liabilities/etc. following Bridgeline's assumption of the amended lease; This approach sounds reasonable. \n\n3)  Bridgeline indicated that Dow is of the opinion that approximately $167k is owed by Enron for dewatering brine removal fees ($0.20 per ton of salt removed) - I need your help to determine whether this is accurate; I don't see any basis for this in the agreement.  The $0.20 per ton of salt removed fee, refers to barrels of capacity being created in the Cavern #1.  This is related to the leaching operation.  If the fee is related to the leaching operation, then they might be correct. (Accounting would need to verify their numbers though).  If they are seeking a fee for brine removal during degassing, I don't think they have a basis for this fee.  We need to understand their basis for the claim.  \n\n4)  Bridgeline is desirous of having Cavern #1 (along with the various rights-of-way) conveyed sooner rather than later (and wondered whether we could expedite the approval process on this part of the deal).  I don't know what the advantages/disadvantages there are to this but would love your input along with your thoughts on whether this is feasible or not; We have until July 1, 2002 to convey the Cavern #1.  To the extent we wanted to wait to wrap up all our issues and convey at that time, we are not harmed under the Partnership agreement.  Obviously we retain any risks associated with ownership of the cavern. \n\n5)  We indicated that we thought the approval process would take approximately 30 days from the day that we reached what we believed were mutually agreeable terms with Bridgeline (does this sound right?) - The goal is to be done no later than March 1, 2002; and I think this sounds reasonable. \n\n6)  Eric Booth is going to call Robert Morgan to get the support for the $550k of expenses relating to the dewatering line and the flowline.\n\nStuart"", ""THANKS FOR YOUR HELP\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tBass, Eric  \nSent:\tThursday, February 14, 2002 4:47 PM\nTo:\tParks, Joe\nSubject:\tFW: Broker quotes required for validation - Texas\nImportance:\tHigh\n\ni filled in what i know.  i know there are some gaps in the quotes so we might need some more hsc qoutes.  i think you know that the carthage, katy-tail, et al curves are the same as hsc.  let me know if you need me to do more.\n\nthanks joe,\neric\n\n\n << File: Texas Quote List.xls >> \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tBowler, Tim  \nSent:\tThursday, February 14, 2002 4:23 PM\nTo:\tParks, Joe; Denetsosie, Troy; Bass, Eric\nCc:\tConsidine, Keith; Barone, Michael; Considine, Keith; 'mark.allan.smith@us.pwcglobal.com'; 'eric.gronningsater@us.pwcglobal.com'\nSubject:\tBroker quotes required for validation - Texas\nImportance:\tHigh\n\nGentlemen,\n\nAttached is a spreadsheet of Enron's curve names for the Texas book.

EOL passed us 25 Gas and 40 power scenarios of which we tested a subset of transactions.  Today's test went a bit smoother given we pushed for the counterparties, contracts to be setup in advance.  We will continue with the Gas settlement on Tuesday morning, along with SAP processing at 1:00pm.\n \nFrom a technical code perspective, there were no major interface issues.  Including TDS/ Sitara interface to Tagg as discussed earlier.\nErrors reported include continued NT userid \""pilot burn-in\"" issues, as well as replication issues with data.  Given we are processing in a very 'truncated' environment, downstream systems can have missing global data needed (regions, facilities, SAP information).  The open issues are being escalated and should be addressed by 10:00am tomorrow morning.\n \nThe goals of this regression test on Monday/ Tuesday are:\n1) regression test a subset of scenarios (ie Physical Gas Sale, Physical Power Supply, Financial Swap, Intercomapny) now that the Global Data is more stable (UBS internal counterparties, profit centers, desks/ books) \n2) Identify any reference to internal/ external screens that still have 'ENRON' reference, or 'EOL' reference\n3) Ensure we have the latest price curve data from updates (ie TAGG/ERMS)\n4) process new EOL data created for Monday.  To verify mid/ back office, including SAP processing.   EOL will also push data from a mock trading session for on 2/7 (see below) \n5) provide the test data scenarios for SAP testing (scheduled Tuesday 1pm).  SAP is completing their setup with the new controlling area for NetCo. \n6) Continue with NT Logins involved with PILOT until remaining are ported.\n \n \nAccomplishments/  what worked?\n1) Confirmation/ updates of most recent price curves into ERMS.  The data prior was from mid December.\n2) Working with only the subset of counterparties as authorized as 'Active'\n3) EOL deals did flow downstream.  However, the major were future periods that we cannot settle.  We modified the data to correspond to what downstream needed.\n4) Gas - Volume Management, Logistics, and leading into Settlement\n5) Power/ Financial  - EnPower/ Tagg, confirmations, leading into settlement\n \n \nWhat did not?\n1) Canada testing is still catching up, but improving.  They are identifying the counterparties, pipelines, test scenarios and anticipate continuing to test Tuesday.   \n2) Facilities missing, Canada pipelines missing, contracts not replicating into Unify (resolved). \n3) Unify Tagg Deal Load.  The Unify Tagg Deal load was discovered at 5pm, and will be addressed early Tuesday am.\n \nFocus on Tuesday\nGiven the new SAP environment has not been tested to date, we will monitor the Unify transmission/ SAP processing (scheduled for 1pm till).  \nThere is much risk within SAP given the new counterparties, entities, xref tables, SAP information is just being setup.  We will also validate the intercompany transactions created on Monday.\n \nNote:  Tuesday night (6pm - 8pm) is the scheduled NetCo test with Estate Shutdown.\n \nAttachments to provide more detail:\n    Integration Testing ISSUES.xls (see tab page for 0204)\n    0204 Global Data Setup AND transactions.xls  (See tab page for 0204 open issues)\n \n \nRegards,\n\nRegan Smith \nEnergy Operations Systems \nEnron Net Works \n713-853-9291 (wk); 281-850-7551 (cell) \n\n "", ""Sorry, \n \nIncorrect date on User Test Doc (was Feb 3,4).
